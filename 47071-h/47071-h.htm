<p>"Ready, Perk?"</p>

<p>"Hold up there, Chub! Don't ye git in sich a tarnal
hurry. What am I goin' to do with this here rope?"</p>

<p>"Why, cast it off, of course. How can you expect to
fly with the rope holdin' you back?"</p>

<p>"Waal, now, wait; le's understand this thing. It's my
idee, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Sure. You drew the plans an' I put the machine together."</p>

<p>"If any picters is published in the papers, mine goes
in bigger'n yours, don't it?"</p>

<p>"That's all to the good, Perk. When the reporters
write this up, you'll be the king-pin. The invention is
yours, and all I did was to put it together. But you're
a pretty old man to try it out, Perk. You'd better let
me take the first spin."</p>

<p>"Bein' the inventor, I reckon I got a right to show
off a little. Purty nigh all my life I been a hootin',
tootin' disturber o' the peace, committin' depperdations
as makes me blush to think of; but right here is where
I do somethin' fer civilization an' progress, which'll go
a good ways to'rds makin' up fer the past. I'm plumb
hungry, Chub, to hear folks say: 'That there flyin' machine
is the biggest thing o' the twentieth century, an'
Welcome Perkins done it. He used to be a howlin', cut-an'-slash
desperado in his younger days, but now he's
turned over a new leaf, an' is devotin' his shinin' abilities
to forwardin' the cause o' progress as much as he used
to be fer holdin' it back.' That's what I wants to hear
folks say as they're p'intin' me out, an'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, slush! If you stand up there chinning much
longer, Perk, somebody'll come. You want this to be a
private flight, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Jest at the beginnin', till I see if everythin' works
all right. If there ain't any hitch. I want to make it as
public as possible. I'd be tickled to have the hull town
come out an' see me cuttin' figger eight's in the clouds.
'It can't be that one-legged feller up there is Welcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Perkins, the ole ex-pirate o' the plains as has been living
right here among us, can it?' the people will say, awed-like,
turnin' to each other. Then I'll fly low, so'st to let
'em make sure, an' laugh exultin'-like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Back to the woods for you, Perk; go ahead an' fly.
Don't stand there talkin' about it."</p>

<p>"Sure Susie ain't got back yit, an' nobody else ain't
lookin'?"</p>

<p>"Don't fret about that, Perk. We're all alone out
here, but there's no tellin' how long we'll be by ourselves
if you lose much more time."</p>

<p>There was a very peculiar situation in the McReady
back yard. A stout pole, some thirty feet high, stood
firmly planted in the ground. Half way up the pole a
platform had been constructed, and on this platform
stood an old, one-legged gentleman surrounded by a lot
of canvas wings. There was a canvas tail behind to be
depressed or lifted, according as the old gentleman
wanted to fly up or down; and there was a propeller just
in front of the tail, which was to be worked by foot-power
and keep the machine going. The aeroplane had
been hoisted to its elevated position by means of a stout
rope passing through a pulley at the top of the pole.</p>

<p>The one-legged man was Welcome Perkins, and the
red-headed boy on the ground was Chub McReady&mdash;who
was something of an inventor himself, although this
flying machine had been designed wholly by Welcome.</p>

<p>Slowly Welcome untied the rope from the flying machine,
and Chub pulled it through the pulley and then
coiled it up on the ground at the foot of the pole.
Thereupon Welcome pushed into the manhole of the flying
machine and began hoisting himself up and down,
preparatory to springing off. He stopped suddenly, however,
and pulled out of the machine to look down at
Chub.</p>

<p>"I reckon, Chub," he observed, as by an afterthought,
"I'll fly around the dome o' the capitol half a dozen
times an' then light on the weather-vane so'st the governor
kin have a chanst to look out o' the cupola winder
an' thank me fer this boon to the human race.
Mebby I'll perch on top o' the court-house, too, fer a
spell, an' take a leetle fly out by the Injun school. If I
don't git back airly, don't be in a takin' about me,
er&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, shucks!" roared Chub. "If you're afraid to
start, Perk, come down an' let me try it."</p>

<p>"Afraid!" snorted Welcome. "You know blame' well
I ain't afraid o' nothin' on the airth 'r over it. I wisht
you'd stuck the 'Merican flag on the machine, some'rs,
but I won't stop fer that now. So-long, Chub, I'm
goin' to take wing. Git out yer spy-glass if ye want ter
watch me."</p>

<p>While Chub held his breath, old Welcome made a few
more up and down movements and then leaped from
the platform.</p>

<p>But something must have been wrong. It couldn't
have been the machine, of course, for Chub had O. K.'d
the plans, so it must have been in the way Welcome
manipulated the tail or the wings.</p>

<p>Twenty feet from the foot of the pole flowed the
town canal. By actual measurement, Welcome flew
twenty-five feet; then the canvas fabric turned itself inside
out, and, with a wild yell, the old man dropped
into the water. There was a tremendous splash, and a
small-sized geyser shot upward.</p>

<p>Loud shouts came from around the corner of the
house, and Matt King and Tom Clipperton rushed into
sight and darted for the canal to give Welcome a helping
hand. Matt grabbed up the rope at the foot of the
pole as he ran past.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" cried Chub, joining in the race for the
canal, "where'd you fellers come from?"</p>

<p>"Rode up on our motor-cycles," replied Matt, "and
hung around the corner to see the show. Foolish business,
Chub. Welcome might have broken his neck&mdash;or
that other leg."</p>

<p>"It was his own notion, that machine. I was sure it
would fly, but I headed him for the canal, so if anything
went wrong he'd have a soft place to drop."</p>

<p>By that time the boys were at the canal, and Matt
threw the rope. Welcome, sputtering and floundering,
was tangled in the wreckage. He had sense enough left
to catch the rope, and Matt dragged him out of the torn
canvas, and all three of the boys lifted him up on the
bank.</p>

<p>"That's the last time," fumed Welcome, dancing
around and holding his head on one side to get the
water out of his ear, "the very last time, Chub McReady,
I'm goin' to try any more o' your fool contraptions. I
might a' been kilt! 'Tain't your fault I wasn't."</p>

<p>"It wasn't my contraption, Perk," answered Chub,
smothering a laugh, now that he was certain Welcome
hadn't suffered any particular damage. "It was yours."</p>

<p>"Dad-bing!" yelled Welcome, more worked up over
the fun the boys were getting out of the situation than
he was over the accident itself. "Ye goaded me on,
ye know ye did! I ain't a-goin' to stand no more. Lawlessness
is b'ilin' around inside o' me, an' I'm goin' to
git right out! Instid o' helpin' progress, like I was
intendin', I'm goin' to cut loose, out there in the hills,
an' give it a back-set. You hear me? Wow! Laff!
laff all ye want! When they git out the U. S. Army to
chase me, an' run me down, I reckon ye'll laugh on
t'other side yer face. An' it was you done it, Chub
McReady! That's somethin' fer you to think about!"</p>

<p>The old man whirled and galloped for the house,
growling to himself, jabbing his wooden pin viciously
into the ground with every step, and leaving a watery
trail as he went. Chub keeled over on the ground, kicked
his feet in the air, and roared.</p>

<p>"It's a cinch," he guffawed, "that that's the last flyin'
machine Perk'll try to invent. We thought we was
havin' this experiment entirely private, an' I guess Perk
thought I'd given you fellers the tip, so you could be
hangin' around. That didn't help his temper any."</p>

<p>"We got here just before Welcome jumped off," said
Matt. "I couldn't figure out what he was trying to do,
at first, or I'd have rushed out and tried to stop him."</p>

<p>"You couldn't have stopped him!" snickered Chub.
"The old boy had the bit in his teeth."</p>

<p>"Ducking was all right," grinned Clip. "May have
been a good thing. Cooled his spirit, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Punk! His pesky spirit will break out somewhere
else, you see. Perk is a human volcano, an' he's got
to have an eruption just about so often or he can't be
happy. But why are you fellers showin' up here so early
in the morning?"</p>

<p>"Clip and I are going to Denver on our motor-cycles,"
answered Matt. "We just came around to say
good-by."</p>

<p>Chub's face fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>"On the level?" he asked. "Hang it all, Matt it can't
be you're goin' to-day?"</p>

<p>"We are, if nothing bobs up to keep us back. I've
been trying to start for two or three weeks, but at the
last moment I generally run into something that interferes
with my plans. Clip has bought Penny's motor-cycle,
we've laid out our route, and we want to get
away early this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Say," exploded Chub, "if I had a motor-cycle I'm
hanged if I wouldn't go with you."</p>

<p>"I've got a picture of you leaving Ph&oelig;nix now," returned
Matt, "while your father is getting to work developing
his mine. You'll have to help him, Chub.
Where's Susie? I want to say good-by to her before
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Matt broke off his words. Fate had already interfered
two or three times with his start for Denver, and
just then Fate was getting ready to repeat the old performance.</p>

<p>A far-away rattle, growing steadily in volume, broke
on the ears of the boys. Whirling around, they stared
across the canal and toward the road on the other side of
the bridge.</p>

<p>What they saw sent the blood racing through their
veins.</p>

<p>Four scrubby cayuses, hitched to a wood-hauler's
wagon, were running away. The wagon was nothing
more than two pairs of wheels connected by a "reach."
As the vehicle leaped and swayed from one side of the
road to the other, the startled eyes of the boys made out
a small figure clinging to the "reach" for dear life.</p>

<p>"There's a girl on that wagon!" cried Chub breathlessly.</p>

<p>The girl could not have been more than five or six
years old, and her dangerous situation appealed to Matt
and aroused a swift determination to save her if it could
possibly be done.</p>

<p>Without a word, he picked up the rope with which
he had dragged Welcome out of the canal and darted for
the gate in front of the house. As he ran, his fingers
were busy knotting a noose in the rope's end.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A QUEER SITUATION.</p>


<p>Motor Matt was never long about making up his mind
as to what he was going to do. In the present instance
an expedient flashed through his brain which might, or
might not, succeed.</p>

<p>The rope which had been used to hoist the aeroplane
to the staging on the pole was a long one. As Matt
ran through the gate, he flung the noose which he had
tied in the rope over a hitching-post, and then leaped
across the road.</p>

<p>By that time the four horses had crossed the bridge
and were thundering on toward the front of the house.
Matt, holding the rope firmly, stretched it so as to bring
it across directly in front of the leaders.</p>

<p>Clipperton, instantly divining Matt's plan, started toward
him, with the intention of helping him hang onto
the end of the rope. But Matt had other plans for him
and Chub.</p>

<p>"Keep back, Clip!" he yelled. "When I make 'em slow
down, you and Chub grab the bits."</p>

<p>Just then the front wheels of the wagon separated
from those in the rear. The "reach" went on with the
forward axle, and the back wheels spun around, dashed
across the road, and smashed into the fence. The end
of the "reach" had struck the ground with terrific force,
and the girl was dragged along with it.</p>

<p>Why didn't she let go? was the thought that plunged
through Matt's mind. The next moment he had no
time to think or to do anything else but give his attention
to the work in hand.</p>

<p>There was a shock like an earthquake as the front
horses of the team hit the rope. Matt, clinging like grim
death to the stout hemp, was jerked into the air and
hurled forward and inward. The pace of the leaders was
checked, and the wheel-horses tried to play leap-frog
with them, the result being that the whole team became
entangled in the harness.</p>

<p>Clip and Chub, throwing themselves at the heads of
the leaders, grabbed the bits. Before the rope was pulled
from Matt's hands, the horses were at a standstill.</p>

<p>As soon as Clip and Chub had the team in hand, Matt
ran to the girl. She was lying on the ground close to
the end of the "reach" and an exclamation escaped
Matt's lips when he saw that she was tied to the piece
of timber that had connected the front wheels with those
behind.</p>

<p>"Is she hurt?" called Clip.</p>

<p>"She must be," answered Matt. "I don't see how she
could go through what she has without being hurt&mdash;and
badly hurt at that. She's unconscious. Some one tied
her to the wagon."</p>

<p>He went down on his knees, and, with his pocket-knife,
severed the rope that secured the girl to the
"reach."</p>

<p>He was about to pick her up in his arms when a
panting voice called out to him:</p>

<p>"Leaf her alone! I will be taking care of her."</p>

<p>Matt straightened on his knees and looked at the
speaker. The man was a Mexican, and had a surly, ill-omened
face. He was covered with dust, and had evidently
been racing after the team on foot. Behind him
another Mexican was coming.</p>

<p>The little girl was American&mdash;Matt could tell that by
her looks. That being the case, why was she with the
two Mexicans? And why had she been tied to the
wagon?</p>

<p>"Does the team belong to you?" demanded Matt.</p>

<p>"Yas, he b'long to me. I left him by de store, an' he
git scare' an' make a run off. <i>Carramba</i>! He bust my
wagon all up. I take care of de girl, señor. She hurt,
huh?"</p>

<p>The other Mexican, scarcely giving a look at the girl,
passed on to the horses and began to pound them with
a stick that he was carrying. His attack was so brutal
that Clip grabbed the stick out of his hand, and would
have laid it over his back if Chub had not interfered.</p>

<p>"Cut it out, Clip," said Chub. "The greaser don't
know any better. About half o' these wood-haulers ain't
any more'n half-baked."</p>

<p>"He'll have the team running again," scowled Clipperton.
"He ought to have some sense pounded into
him."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Matt, paying no heed to the other Mexican,
had picked up the little girl and was carrying her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
toward the gate. The Mexican ran after him and
grabbed his arm.</p>

<p>"You gif her to me!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"This is the most ungrateful outfit of greasers I ever
met up with," cried Clip, hurrying toward the second
man. "That'll do for you!" he said angrily, catching
the fellow by the collar and throwing him back.</p>

<p>The Mexican whirled, his little eyes glittering like a
snake's. One hand darted toward the breast of his coat.</p>

<p>"Look out Clip!" warned Chub. "He's going to pull
a knife on you."</p>

<p>Clip still had the club he had taken from the Mexican's
companion, and he squared away threateningly.
There was a scar in the shape of a cross on the man's
swarthy cheek, and it glowed redly with the anger that
filled him.</p>

<p>Before the clash could proceed any farther, a man
came galloping up on horseback. The boys recognized
him at once as Mr. McKibben, the sheriff. The Mexicans
also seemed to recognize him, for the one by the
horses slunk in between the animals' heads, and the other
at once lost his truculent manner.</p>

<p>"What's going on here?" demanded McKibben, peering
sharply at the Mexican, and then swerving his gaze
to Matt and the unconscious form in his arms.</p>

<p>"The team ran away, Mr. McKibben," explained Matt,
"and this girl was tied to the 'reach.' It looks as though
she was badly hurt. I want to carry her into the house
and this fellow was trying to take her away from me."</p>

<p>"H'm!" muttered the sheriff, getting down from his
horse, "it's a cinch the girl don't belong to them." He
stepped closer to the Mexican, his eyes on the scar.
"Where'd you get the girl?" he demanded, one hand
groping in his pocket.</p>

<p>"The <i>niño</i>?" returned the Mexican shiftily. "She
b'long to a friend of mine, señor. I take her to him. I
no like to leave her here."</p>

<p>The sheriff's hand came out of his pocket with a rush,
bringing a pair of handcuffs along with it. In less time
than it takes to tell it, one of the cuffs was about the
Mexican's right wrist, while the other was snapped about
McKibben's left.</p>

<p>The Mexican gave a backward jump, but the sheriff,
with a pull of the arm, drew him back with a jerk that
almost lifted him off his feet. Once more the Mexican's
hand was plunged into the breast of his coat. It was
the left hand this time, however, and he was awkward
in using it. McKibben's fingers gripped the wrist
of the hand as it was withdrawn and shook a knife out
of it.</p>

<p>"None of that, Juan Morisco!" growled McKibben.
"You see, I know you. I've had you watched ever since
you reached town, so you'll just walk along with me and
not make any trouble about it."</p>

<p>There was a rattle of hoofs up the road.</p>

<p>"The other one's making a getaway, Mr. McKibben,"
sang out Chub excitedly. "He took one of the horses
and&mdash;&mdash; Holy smoke, watch him go!"</p>

<p>The sheriff turned and flashed a look after the retreating
horseman.</p>

<p>"I can follow him," said Clip. "I'll use your horse."</p>

<p>"Let him go," answered McKibben. "He's only the
wood-hauler. This is the man I want. Take the girl
into the house, King," he added. "You might ride my
horse to the corral, Clipperton, and get a doctor."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about this girl?" asked Matt,
looking down at the head that was lying limply over his
arm.</p>

<p>"Not a thing; but I'll bet money there's crooked work
of some kind going on. The girl didn't belong with
these Mexicans."</p>

<p>"If they hadn't tied her to the wagon," said Matt,
"she would have got clear of that accident without being
so badly hurt."</p>

<p>"We'll get Juan in the sweat-box and find out about
it."</p>

<p>"What have you pinched the greaser for, Mr. McKibben?"
asked Chub.</p>

<p>"Don't get so curious, McReady," parried the sheriff.
"Hitch those three horses to the fence, and I'll send some
one after them and the wreck of the wagon. Do what
you can for the girl, King."</p>

<p>Clip got on the sheriff's animal and started for the
bridge; Chub went to the horses which, by that time, had
quieted down, and started toward the fence with them;
McKibben took his prisoner toward town; and Matt
pushed on through the gate and into the house.</p>

<p>This was a mysterious affair from start to finish, and
he was wondering what would come of it.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">"RAGS."</p>


<p>Susie McReady, who had been visiting with a friend
over in town, came home a little while after Matt had
laid the girl down on a couch. Chub entered the house
with his sister, and was excitedly telling her what had
happened.</p>

<p>Susie went at once to the girl and began doing what
she could for her.</p>

<p>"It's too bad," murmured Susie sympathetically, as she
passed a wet cloth back and forth over the girl's face.
"Poor little thing! She hardly seems to have any breath
left in her."</p>

<p>"An' she don't seem to be hurt anywhere," said Chub,
standing close to the couch with Matt, "that's the queerest
part of it."</p>

<p>"She may be hurt internally," spoke up Matt, feeling
a pang of pity as he looked at the pale little face.</p>

<p>The girl's clothing was so ragged it was a wonder
that it held together. Her shoes were broken and scuffed
out, and there were holes in her stockings.</p>

<p>The cold water revived her, and when her big eyes
flickered open, they passed in a troubled daze from Susie
to Chub, and then to Matt. When they rested on Matt,
a faint smile came to her lips.</p>

<p>"Yous is de one dat was runnin' acrost de road wid
a rope," said she. "Dat was bully, w'at yous done. Put
'er dere, cull," and she lifted herself on one elbow and
reached out her hand.</p>

<p>"You're feeling a whole lot better, eh?" asked Matt,
taking the dirty little paw.</p>

<p>"Well, mebby," was the hesitating answer, "only I
can't move me pins. What's de matter wid 'em?"</p>

<p>She looked down at her feet as Matt released her
hand. Susie cast a frightened glance at Matt.</p>

<p>"Are you trying to move your feet?" Matt asked, hiding
as best he could the sudden consternation that swept
through him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure I'm tryin'. Funny, ain't it? Dey feel like dey
wasn't mine."</p>

<p>"Well, don't fret about it," said Matt softly. "When
the doctor comes he'll fix you up all right. What's your
name?"</p>

<p>"Rags," was the answer.</p>

<p>"You've got another name besides that, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Sure; but yous don't hear me sayin' it, I guess." Her
face hardened a little as she added: "Yous has done a lot
fer me"&mdash;here she fixed her large eyes steadily on Matt&mdash;"an'
I'd do a lot fer yous, on'y don't ask me name or
anyt'ing about meself; see? Dat goes. Come around
here an' grab holt o' me mitt. Dere ain't nobody treated
me white fer quite a spell. De rest is all right, but yous
is de one dat's made a hit wid Rags."</p>

<p>Susie drew back a little and Chub pushed up a chair.
Matt humored the child and sat down beside her.</p>

<p>"W'at d'yous call yerself?" she asked, snuggling
Matt's hand against her cheek.</p>

<p>"Matt," he answered.</p>

<p>"Gee, but yous is fine! Say, ain't yous de Motor Matt
de push has been talkin' about?"</p>

<p>"They call me that sometimes."</p>

<p>She laughed, and her eyes danced as they looked into
his.</p>

<p>"Ain't it great t' have a feller like yous stop a runaway
team an' pull yous out o' de smash! Why, yous
saved me jest like yous did Dirk Hawley's goil, only
she was ridin' a horse while I was hangin' to a busted
wagon."</p>

<p>"Who were those men with you, Rags?" queried Matt.</p>

<p>"Cut it out, Matt. Dat's somet'ing I can't tell yous."</p>

<p>"Have you lived long in Ph&oelig;nix?</p>

<p>"Dere yous go ag'in! Say, I hope dem pins git so's
I kin use 'em before long. I ain't got no money an' I
can't be spongin' on folks dat mebby don't want me
around."</p>

<p>"You can stay right here, Rags, as long as you want
to," put in Susie, "and it won't cost you a cent."</p>

<p>"Not a red!" added Chub heartily.</p>

<p>"Dat's mighty kind," answered Rags, "but I got t' fly
my kite jest as soon's I kin git on me uppers."</p>

<p>"Is Juan Morisco a friend of yours, Rags?" asked
Matt, still trying to get some information from the
girl.</p>

<p>"What's dat?" demanded Rags, starting up and looking
hard at Matt. "How'd yous know w'at his name
was?"</p>

<p>"The sheriff arrested him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jugged! Are yous givin' it to me straight?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Rags lay back and closed her eyes in a tired way.</p>

<p>"Well," she muttered, "dey won't git nuttin' out o'
me."</p>

<p>The doctor came, just then, and for several minutes
he gave his undivided attention to Rags. When he had
got through, and had left some medicine, he beckoned
Matt to follow him out on the porch. The moment they
were clear of the house the doctor's face became very
grave.</p>

<p>"Not much hope for her," said he.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Matt, taken aback. "Do you mean
she can't get well?"</p>

<p>"Chances don't favor it. There's an injury to her
spine and she's paralyzed from the hips down. What
do you know about her, King?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing, doctor, and she won't say a word about
herself. But maybe the man the sheriff arrested can be
made to tell something."</p>

<p>The doctor, apparently, had been told all about the
runaway and the arrest of the Mexican, by Clip.</p>

<p>"There's something here that's mighty mysterious,"
said he, shaking his head. "This Juan Morisco must be
a hard citizen or McKibben wouldn't have nabbed him.
And what was the girl doing with Morisco, tied to
the wagon like she was? Got to make her talk, King.
You seem to have more influence over her than any one
else. She's too young to have much strength of will,
and I think she'll tell you everything if you keep trying
to make her."</p>

<p>"That's where you're wrong, doctor," said Matt.
"From what I've seen of her I'll bet she won't say a
word. Rags has got a reason for keeping back what
she knows, and she'd let you kill her before she'd breathe
a whisper."</p>

<p>"Well, I hear McKibben is giving Juan Morisco the
third degree. If Morisco can stand that, he's a better
man than I think he is. One way or another, the truth
about that girl is bound to come out."</p>

<p>The doctor got into his buggy and drove off. Matt
stood at the gate for a few moments, looking for Clip;
but, as he could see nothing of him, he went back into
the house.</p>

<p>Rags was asleep. Susie, who sat beside the couch,
looked at Matt and laid a finger on her lips. Matt tiptoed
out through the kitchen to the back of the house.
Chub was sitting in a chair, tilted back against the wall.</p>

<p>"What's old Sawbones got to say, pard?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not much hope for Rags, Chub," said Matt gravely.</p>

<p>"Too bloomin' bad!" muttered Chub, "but mebby old
pills-an'-physic has made a wrong guess."</p>

<p>"Of course, there's a chance that he's off his reckoning.
Wish I knew why Rags won't tell us anything about herself,
or about those two greasers who had her tied to
the wagon."</p>

<p>"She's a nervy little piece! Mebby she'll tell you,
though, if you give her time. You seem to make a hit
with all the girls, Matt, little an' big, an' Rags has taken
to you like a Piute squaw to a string of glass beads."</p>

<p>"Where's Welcome?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>A slow grin worked its way over Chub's freckled
face.</p>

<p>"He's out in his study, soothin' his turbulent soul with
hair-raisin' literature."</p>

<p>"Didn't know he had a study," said Matt.</p>

<p>Chub jerked a thumb over his shoulder at a neighboring
barn.</p>

<p>"It's over there," said he. "Perk's got a box stall all
to himself, an' his library contains everything about
Dick Turpin that was ever written. Come on over an'
we'll take a look at him."</p>

<p>Matt was glad of something that would take his mind
off Rags for a time, and he followed Chub toward the
barn. Approaching softly, Chub placed an empty box
under a square opening that ventilated one of the stalls
and motioned for Matt to get up beside him.</p>

<p>Some shelves had been put up along one side of the
stall, and they were piled with a lot of grimy-looking
books. One of the books lay open on a board placed
over the manger, and Welcome stood in front of it with
an old butcher-knife in his hand. The old man had
twisted up the ends of his mustache to make it look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
bristling and fierce, and he was mumbling to himself and
flashing the butcher-knife around him savagely.</p>

<p>"Le'me see," the boys heard him mutter, as he bent
over the book, "how does that there go? Dad-bing! I
wisht I had my glasses. The print's purty fine an' the
light ain't none too good."</p>

<p>Then he read, tracing the words with the point of the
knife.</p>

<p>"'Gallopin' Dick pulled up his hoss clost by the coach
an' drew a bead on the passengers with his trusty pistol.
"Stand!" he cried; "stand an' deliver!"'"</p>

<p>Welcome jerked himself away from the book, whirled
around on his wooden pin and pointed his knife at the
book-shelves.</p>

<p>"Stop where ye be!" he said fiercely. "It's Eagle-eye
Perkins, Pirate o' the Plains, that's stoppin' this here
stage-coach. Stand an' deliver!"</p>

<p>Just then Chub let off a whoop. Welcome, startled by
the unexpected sound, dropped the knife, jumped for the
side of the stall, and tried to climb up the book-shelves.</p>

<p>Crash went the collection of literature, and Welcome
fell back on the floor of the stall, half-covered by a deluge
of books.</p>

<p>Laughing to themselves, the boys dropped off the box
and started back toward the house.</p>

<p>"What do you think of that!" chuckled Chub. "The
old joke is a nice kind of reformed road-agent, ain't he?
Instead of tryin' to fight down his lawlessness, he's keepin'
it alive with that stuff. I'll bet if sis ever finds out
about his doin's there'll be a ruction, and&mdash;&mdash; Hello!
here comes Clip, an' he's tearin' along as though he was
goin' over the course for a record."</p>

<p>The boys had reached a place where they could see
the road. Clipperton, on foot, was racing up from the
canal bridge. Clip was the best "miler" anywhere in that
part of the country, and he was certainly hitting nothing
but the high places as he rushed for the McReady front
gate.</p>

<p>"Let's hike for the road and find out what he's got on
his mind," suggested Matt.</p>

<p>He and Chub reached the gate just as Clipperton came
up with it.</p>

<p>"Get the <i>Comet</i>, Matt," jerked out Clipperton.
"You're wanted on the jump. Hustle."</p>

<p>"Who wants me?" demanded Matt.</p>

<p>"The governor. It's a hurry-up call. McKibben said
for you not to lose a minute."</p>

<p>"What does the governor want me for?"</p>

<p>As Matt put the question he was running for his
motor-cycle.</p>

<p>"That's too many for me," answered Clip. "All I
know's what I'm telling you. Something in the wind.
No getaway for Denver for us to-day."</p>

<p>"Where'll I find Governor Gaynor?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>He was pushing his machine through the gate, and
Clip was getting his own wheel and making ready to
follow.</p>

<p>"In his office," answered Clip. "He's waiting for you
there."</p>

<p>Matt got into the saddle and began pedaling. The
next moment the pistons took the push and the motor
began to snap. By the time he reached the bridge the
cylinders were purring softly and the <i>Comet</i> was going
like a limited express.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A DANGEROUS MISSION.</p>


<p>"I don't think the boy can make it, McKibben; I don't
know whether it's right to ask him to try to make it."</p>

<p>The governor was pacing back and forth in his private
office, talking with the sheriff who sat near-by.
Something of importance was in the wind, as could
plainly be told from the faces of the two men and from
the nervous actions of the governor.</p>

<p>"There's nothing that lad can't do when he sets his
mind to it," declared McKibben. "If Joe Dangerfield
and his gang are kept from reaching Mexico, it's Motor
Matt that does it. Take my word for that, governor."</p>

<p>"Do you think you can believe what Juan Morisco told
you?" queried the governor.</p>

<p>"I'll take my oath it was the truth."</p>

<p>"If word reaches the Dangerfield gang about what
we're doing, King will never be allowed to reach his
destination."</p>

<p>"How can word reach the gang? When the boy starts
he'll go like a streak of greased lightning. He'll beat
the news, even if there was a leak somewhere and the
information that he was acting as your courier got
started toward the hills."</p>

<p>"I sha'n't let him start until I have told him all about
the danger&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>McKibben laughed.</p>

<p>"That youngster don't know what fear is, governor.
He won't gigg back on the job because of any trouble
that may be staring him in the face. Anyhow, he's our
only hope. There's not a machine in town that can
cover the ground like it's got to be covered, except the
<i>Comet</i>; and there's no one else to use the <i>Comet</i> except
Motor Matt."</p>

<p>"He's slow getting here, seems to me," muttered the
governor, starting for a window to look out.</p>

<p>Before he reached the window a rap fell on the door.
In answer to his call, the governor's secretary entered.</p>

<p>"Here's young King, sir," announced the secretary.</p>

<p>"Have him come right in," said the governor, a look
of relief crossing his face.</p>

<p>The secretary withdrew, and the next moment Matt
entered and stood before the two men, cap in hand.</p>

<p>"You sent for me, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>This was not the first time Governor Gaynor had seen
Motor Matt, but never before had he marked the sturdy
bearing and resourceful air of the lad as he did then.
Somehow, his feeling of relief increased, and he sat down
in the big chair before his desk.</p>

<p>"Yes, King," said he; "I sent for you. How would
you like to do a little brisk, and perhaps exciting, work
for Uncle Sam and the Territory of Arizona?"</p>

<p>"I'll be glad to do anything I can," answered Matt, not
a little curious because of the governor's words and
manner.</p>

<p>"There may be danger in it, King," went on the
governor, eying the lad's face keenly, "a great deal of
danger."</p>

<p>"That ought to keep me gingered up," smiled Matt
easily.</p>

<p>McKibben chuckled and swerved his eyes to the governor.</p>

<p>"There'll also be one hundred dollars in it for you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's all right, too, sir," said Matt. "I could use
the hundred."</p>

<p>"Briefly, then," proceeded the governor briskly, "the
work is this: A man named Joe Dangerfield, with several
other ruffians, is camped at Tinaja Wells, near Painted
Rocks. They're a lawless set, those fellows, and have
been engaged in smuggling Chinamen into the United
States by way of Mexico and the Arizona border. The
Federal Government has offered a reward of one thousand
dollars each for the capture of Dangerfield or any
of his gang.</p>

<p>"Jasper Burke, the sheriff from Prescott, is camped
with a posse at Potter's Gap, just over the divide, at the
head of Castle Creek Cañon. Dangerfield and his gang
are known to be making for the Mexican border, to get
away from the authorities and so effect their escape.
The trail south from Tinaja Wells passes through Potter's
Gap, and Burke and his posse are waiting there
to catch the Dangerfield outfit as it comes along.</p>

<p>"It appears now, however, that Dangerfield has got
wind of the sheriff's move, and that he is going to leave
Tinaja Wells some time to-night and start south by another
route. Now, Potter's Gap is a hundred miles
from Ph&oelig;nix, and unless I can find a courier who will
get a letter into Burke's hands by five o'clock this afternoon,
the Dangerfield gang will escape into Mexico."</p>

<p>The governor's eyes sought a clock on the wall.</p>

<p>"It lacks fifteen minutes of noon," said he. "If you
can get started by twelve o'clock, you will have just five
hours to make a 'century' run&mdash;and a rough run it will
be for a part of the way. Can you make it?"</p>

<p>A large map of Arizona hung near the clock. Matt
stepped toward it.</p>

<p>"Can you show me, Mr. McKibben," he asked, "how
I'll have to go to reach Potter's Gap?"</p>

<p>"Sure, Matt," answered the sheriff, getting out of
his chair and drawing his finger over the map as he
talked. "This here's the Black Cañon road out of
Ph&oelig;nix&mdash;you know that pretty well by this time, I
reckon. The road forks this side of the Bluebell Mine,
and you take the fork. That leads you to Frog Tanks
and Castle Creek Cañon. You go up the cañon to a
point five miles north of Hot Springs; there you'll find a
trail leading up the right-hand wall of the cañon and
over the divide to Potter's Gap. The hard part of
your trip will come getting over the divide."</p>

<p>"Any place on the trail where I can get gasoline?"
asked Matt. "The <i>Comet's</i> tank will only hold enough
for about seventy-five miles. If I can't get any on the
way, I'll have to take some with me. Won't have to
bother with oil. The oil-tank holds a quart, and that
will keep me going for two hundred miles."</p>

<p>"Better take some gasoline along and make sure,"
said McKibben. "You might be able to get some at Hot
Springs, or at Frog Tanks; but there's a doubt, and you
can't be in doubt of anything on this trip."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir."</p>

<p>"Think you can find your way all right?"</p>

<p>"It looks easy on the map, but I might take Clipperton
along. He knows the country like a book, and he's got
a motor-cycle of his own now. His machine is a one-cylinder,
and not as fast as the <i>Comet</i>, but if I see Clip
can't keep the pace, I can leave him behind."</p>

<p>"It's all right to take one of your chums with you,
King," put in the governor; "in fact, it may be a mighty
good thing for you to have some one else along. If
Dangerfield and his men are captured, it means that they
will spend a good long time in the penitentiary; and if
they find out you are carrying word to Burke that will
keep them from reaching Mexico, they'll do everything
in their power to stop you."</p>

<p>"How'll they find out, sir? I'll keep ahead of the
news all the way."</p>

<p>"That's what I'm hoping you'll do; but this Dangerfield
gang is well organized, and the fact that they've
discovered Burke and his posse are laying for them at
Potter's Gap proves they're keeping track of things."</p>

<p>The governor whirled around to his desk and picked
up an envelope.</p>

<p>"I'll not keep you any longer," said he, "for you have
little enough time for your 'century' run as it is. Here
are the instructions which you are to deliver to Burke.
Put the letter away safely."</p>

<p>Matt opened his leather jacket and tucked the letter
into the inside pocket.</p>

<p>"Did you find out all this from Juan Morisco, Mr.
McKibben?" he asked.</p>

<p>The sheriff nodded.</p>

<p>"That scar on Juan's face gave him away," said he.
"How's the girl?"</p>

<p>The sheriff's eyes widened when he heard the report.</p>

<p>"She won't say a word about herself, or about Juan
Morisco," went on Matt.</p>

<p>"Can't blame her for that," said the sheriff.</p>

<p>It was plain that Morisco had told the sheriff something
about Rags, and Matt would have liked to hear
what it was. Time was pressing just then, however, and
he had no wish to talk any longer.</p>

<p>As he was about to leave the room, the governor
caught his hand, shook it heartily, and wished him luck.</p>

<p>"I have confidence in your ability to take care of
yourself, King," said he; "if I hadn't, I shouldn't allow
you to make this venture under any consideration. Keep
a sharp look-out for trouble, that's all, and put the <i>Comet</i>
through for all she's worth."</p>

<p>"I'll get your letter into Burke's hands, Governor Gaynor,"
declared Matt, "by five o'clock. Good-by, sir."</p>

<p>As he left the office the clock was striking twelve.</p>

<p>"He'll do it, too," declared McKibben.</p>

<p>A few moments after the door closed behind Matt,
the secretary presented himself. He wore a troubled
air.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Jenkins?" queried the governor.</p>

<p>"Perhaps nothing, sir," answered Jenkins; "but when
young King came in to see you, there was a rough-looking
man loafing around the hall. After I had sent
King into your office, I saw the man through the window.
He was hurrying down the walk in front, and I watched
until he got into a motor-car&mdash;a high-powered roadster.
There was another man in the car, and I'm sure they
exceeded the speed-limit as they broke away from the
curb."</p>

<p>The governor, with a trace of consternation, turned
on the sheriff.</p>

<p>"What do you think of that, McKibben?" he asked.</p>

<p>McKibben laughed easily.</p>

<p>"You're letting this Dangerfield business get on your
nerves, governor," said he. "What could that chap who
was loafing in the hall discover just by seeing King come
in here?"</p>

<p>"He might have been friendly toward the Dangerfield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
gang, and he may have made a guess as to why King
had come here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing to it, governor, take it from me. Motor
Matt will pull down that hundred just too easy for
any use. A dollar a mile for that 'century' run looks
pretty good to him, I'll bet. Don't lose any sleep about
<i>him</i>. He'll be back here some time to-morrow, chipper
as usual and a hundred to the good. He's the bank that
gets my gilt, no discount on that."</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE RED ROADSTER.</p>


<p>As Matt hurried out of the capitol building he found
Clip at the curb, waiting for him. Clip's motor-cycle
was leaning against a hitching post, and there was an
ominous look on Clip's swarthy face&mdash;a look that somehow
reminded one of his grim Indian ancestors, for Clip
was proud of the fact that one of his grandparents had
been a full-blood native of the soil.</p>

<p>"What's on?" he asked, as Matt rolled the <i>Comet</i> off
the walk and into the street.</p>

<p>"I've got to do a hard 'century' in five hours," answered
Matt, "and you're to go with me as long as
you can keep up."</p>

<p>A gleam of satisfaction darted through Clip's eyes.</p>

<p>"I was looking for your machine," said he. "Where'd
you leave it, Matt?"</p>

<p>"Left it at the steps, in charge of the janitor. Didn't
intend to give any one a chance to tamper with it.
How's your gasoline-tank, Clip?"</p>

<p>"Full."</p>

<p>"Plenty of oil?"</p>

<p>Clip nodded.</p>

<p>"Same here," went on Matt. "We've got to carry two
quarts more of gasoline with us, and we'll pick it up at
Brigham's."</p>

<p>Brigham's was a general store in the "Five Points,"
and on the boys' direct course to the Black Cañon road.
The machines were soon hustling through Washington
Street as fast as the speed regulations would allow.</p>

<p>"Going up Castle Creek Cañon?" asked Clip, while
he and Matt were gliding along side by side.</p>

<p>"How'd you know that, Clip?" returned Matt.</p>

<p>"Then it's true," muttered Clip darkly. "By thunder!"</p>

<p>The quarter-blood's manner was full of mysterious
foreboding.</p>

<p>"What's true?" came from Matt sharply.</p>

<p>"A red automobile stood in front of the capitol. Was
there when I came up. A rough-looking fellow was in
the driver's seat. Another tough-looking man ran out
of the building and jumped into the red car. 'Motor
Matt's carrying a message,' I heard the second man say
to the driver. 'Castle Creek Cañon, Jem, on the high
speed.' Trouble ahead, Matt," Clip added.</p>

<p>Matt was astounded.</p>

<p>"Was that all you heard, Clip?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That was all."</p>

<p>"Ever see the two men before?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What kind of a car was it?"</p>

<p>"Roadster. Looked like it could go."</p>

<p>Matt puzzled over this disquieting information all the
way to Brigham's. They were held up about five minutes
at the general store, buying a couple of two-quart
canteens and having them filled with gasoline. When
they left the Five Points and shot along Grand Avenue,
each had a receptacle securely lashed to the head of
his machine.</p>

<p>Thirty miles an hour was about the limit of Clip's
motor-cycle. Clip had recently bought the machine of
Ed Penny, and had equipped it with new tires, so that
it was in a perfectly serviceable condition.</p>

<p>Twenty miles an hour for five hours would turn the
trick. But that was too close figuring. The boys were
a quarter of an hour late getting away. This time would
have to be made up, and, besides that, Matt wanted to
gain on the schedule so as to have a little leeway for
possible accidents.</p>

<p>"How's the going between the Arizona Canal and Castle
Creek Cañon, Clip?" queried Matt, as they whirled
into the Black Cañon road.</p>

<p>"Fine to Frog Tanks," answered Clip. "From there
to the cañon not so good. In the cañon it's mighty
poor."</p>

<p>"Then we'll have to make all the time we can at this
end of the route. Open 'er up, Clip!"</p>

<p>Both boys opened the throttles and let the reserve
power shoot through the machinery. The needle of
Matt's speedometer indicated thirty-two miles an hour.</p>

<p>"Great!" cried Matt, after giving Clip the figures.
"That little one-cylinder is just naturally humping herself,
Clip. We've got five hours for the trip, but at this
pace we could almost do it in three."</p>

<p>"Hard trail in the cañon, Matt. There'll be plenty of
lost time there. What's the game, anyway?"</p>

<p>Matt explained as they dashed along. The excitement
of the work ahead brought a glow to Clip's eyes.</p>

<p>"Fine!" he exclaimed. "Motor Matt, the Governor's
Courier! You'll get through on time even if I can't."</p>

<p>"Whether you're in at the finish or not, Clip, we split
that hundred dollars right in two in the middle. If we
ever get started for Denver, old chap, the money will
help."</p>

<p>"But that red roadster!" scowled Clip. "How did
those roughs get next to this work of yours?"</p>

<p>"That's too many for me," answered Matt.</p>

<p>"They must have suspected something. They were
there, in front of the capitol, waiting. Mighty queer!"</p>

<p>Matt's lips compressed into a thin line and his eyes
flashed.</p>

<p>"We'll have to keep a keen look-out for trouble," said
he, "and dodge it, if any comes our way."</p>

<p>A few minutes later they were crossing the bridge
over the Arizona Canal. Matt pulled out his old silver
watch.</p>

<p>"Only sixteen minutes to one," he announced, with a
note of exultation, "and we're fifteen miles on our way."</p>

<p>"Thirty miles to Frog Tanks and twenty to the next
water," said Clip. "We ought to have brought a water-canteen,
too. The heat is something fierce."</p>

<p>"We'll drink at the well, Clip, and pick up something
to eat at the same place. We ought to be there in
forty minutes, at the outside."</p>

<p>After they left the Black Cañon road, just beyond
the bridge, Matt was in a country entirely new to him.
The road was a bit cut up and sandy in places, but Clip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
whaled his machine along and they did a trifle better
than thirty miles.</p>

<p>Two or three roads entered the one they were following,
and they were all as well traveled. Here Matt's
wisdom in bringing Clip along, even at the loss of some
speed on the <i>Comet's</i> part, was made manifest. But for
Clip, Matt might have gone astray on the wrong trail.</p>

<p>The boys were now in the region of big sahuara cacti,
and the great trunks flashed past them as telephone-poles
recede behind a rushing train.</p>

<p>In the dusty places of the road the broad tracks left
by the tires of an automobile could be plainly seen. The
red roadster was ahead of them. Matt studied the skyline
in advance, wondering how far away the two ruffians
were and what their designs could be. He saw nothing
of the red car, and presently the square walls and flat
roof of an adobe house broke on his vision.</p>

<p>Behind the house was a primitive stable, thatched
with grass, and a small corral constructed of ocotilla
poles braided together with wire. Between the house
and stable was an iron pump and a watering-trough.</p>

<p>"That's the ranch where we get our water," remarked
Clip. "Two bits apiece for a drink. There's Gregory,
the rancher, out in front."</p>

<p>Gregory, the rancher, got up in surprise as the boys
came to a stop at the pump. He stared at the machines.</p>

<p>"Waal, I'll be hanged!" he muttered. "They've got
them hossless wagons on four wheels an' two wheels.
Reckon they'll be havin' 'em on one wheel next. Dry?
Help yerself. Two bits apiece fer all ye kin swaller.
Water costs money in the desert."</p>

<p>Leaning their machines against the water-trough, the
boys began working the pump.</p>

<p>"Did you see a horseless wagon on four wheels go
past here, Mr. Gregory?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Sure. Two fellers was on the seat. They stopped
fer water an' then hiked right on, jest as though they
was in a hurry ter git some'r's. Friends o' your'n?"</p>

<p>"No, we don't know them," answered Matt. "How
long since they passed?"</p>

<p>"Less'n five minutes."</p>

<p>"Got anything to eat in your place?" went on Matt.
"We can't stop more than a minute or two."</p>

<p>"Sho!" exclaimed the man. "Ever'body 'pears ter be
in a hurry this arternoon. I got jerked beef, crackers,
an' all kinds o' canned goods, say nothin' erbout&mdash;&mdash;"</p>


<p>"'Jerked' and crackers'll do," interrupted Clip. "We'll
go in, Gregory. Get us a hand-out we can tote in our
pockets."</p>

<p>"Sartain," answered Gregory.</p>

<p>The boys were not in the adobe house to exceed five
minutes, and they wouldn't have been there to exceed
three if Gregory had been a little more spry in his
movements. Stuffing their crackers and dried beef into
their pockets, they ran out of the house and to their
machines. Scarcely taking time to look the motor-cycles
over, they pulled them upright and got into the saddles.</p>

<p>Matt pedaled away, twisting on the gasoline and the
spark. But the motor did not work&mdash;he was still pushing
the machine ahead with the pedals. He halted to investigate
and find out what was wrong, and at that
moment a startled cry came from Clip.</p>

<p>Matt looked around. Clip was having the same
trouble getting his motor-cycle started. But Clip had
made another discovery which sent a shock of consternation
through both him and Matt.</p>

<p>"Our gasoline-cans!" cried Clip. "Where are they?"</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, Matt saw that his reserve
supply of gasoline had been removed from the head of
the <i>Comet</i>. Clip's can had disappeared in the same
mysterious manner. With a sudden, paralyzing thought,
Matt examined the tank back of his saddle.</p>

<p><i>The tank was empty!</i></p>

<p>Doubling up his fists, Clip jumped for Gregory. The
latter sprang back and stared at Clip in astonishment.</p>

<p>"You know who did it!" shouted Clip menacingly.
"The men on that red roadster hired you to stop us!
You had some one hiding here. While we were in
the house the gasoline was taken away. We'll give you
a minute to get it back. Sixty seconds, Gregory!"</p>

<p>The rancher continued to stare.</p>

<p>"I don't know nothin' about what you're gittin' at,"
he muttered blankly. "I ain't makin' trouble fer no one,
an' them other fellers didn't hire me ter do a thing.
Keep away, I tell ye! Thar's two o' you, but I'll give ye
a hot time if ye git too hostile!"</p>

<p>Gregory picked up an ax as he stepped back, and
then stood confronting the boys threateningly.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">SURMOUNTING THE DIFFICULTY.</p>


<p>While this clash was going forward between the
rancher and Clip, Matt's mind had been busy. The
result of his thinking forced the conclusion that Gregory
was innocent of any underhand work.</p>

<p>First, the rancher seemed to be alone at the ranch. If
that was really the case, then there had been no one
belonging to the place to interfere with the machines.
Furthermore, some knowledge of the mechanism of the
motor-cycles had been necessary in order to strip the
machines of their gasoline in the short space of time in
which the work had been done. It was not to be supposed
that any confederate of Gregory's could have had
this knowledge.</p>

<p>"Hold up, Clip," said Matt, dropping a hand on his
chum's arm. "You're on the wrong track. I'm sure
Gregory didn't do this, or have any one do it."</p>

<p>"There wasn't any one else," flared Clip. "If Gregory
didn't do it, he knows who did."</p>

<p>"The red roadster may have stopped farther along the
trail, and one of the men may have come back. Have
you got any gasoline, Gregory?" inquired Matt.</p>

<p>"Nary, I ain't," answered the rancher. "That's what
them other two fellers wanted ter know."</p>

<p>Clip cast a quick look at Matt.</p>

<p>"Mebby they're running short themselves," said Clip.
"They found Gregory didn't have any. Then they made
a dead set at ours."</p>

<p>"Or," went on Matt, "those fellows may have asked
Gregory just to make sure we couldn't get a fresh supply
from him when they had taken what we had. We'll go
on for a while and use the pedals."</p>

<p>"We've lost out," cried Clip angrily. "Just at the
start, too. Nice thing for you to tell the governor."</p>

<p>Matt looked gloomily at his watch, then started off
with all the speed he could throw into the pedals. But
the weight of the machinery, now suddenly useless, pulled
him back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>His hopes were down, way down. His mysterious
enemies had scored a telling stroke at the very start-off.</p>

<p>"What time is it, Matt?" asked Clip, in a discouraged
tone, toiling along beside his chum.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five minutes of two," was the answer.</p>

<p>"We've got three hours and twenty-five minutes to
go sixty-five miles!" Clip laughed gruesomely. "We
couldn't do it in two days, at this rate."</p>

<p>While the boys were talking they came to a long
slope that ran downward through a thick chaparral of
greasewood, palo-verde, and ironwood. The road twisted
serpentlike to avoid rough ground. From somewhere
in the thicket below a muffled <i>thump</i>, <i>thump</i>, <i>thump</i>
came up to them, as though some one was wielding an
ax.</p>

<p>"What's that?" queried Matt, looking at Clip.</p>

<p>"Mexican wood-cutters, I reckon," was the response.</p>

<p>The boys went on down the slope, coasting at a rapid
gait. Half-way down the descent, a turn brought them
into the proximity of an automobile, and so suddenly
that they had to clap on the brakes in order to avoid
a collision.</p>

<p>The car was a red roadster. It was at a standstill in
the middle of the trail, and neither of the two men was
near it.</p>

<p>Astounded at this stroke of luck, Matt and Clip, for
a moment, could do no more than stare at each other.
The blows of the ax, off in the chaparral, were louder
in their ears now, and they could hear a mumble of
voices.</p>

<p>"Wow!" gasped Clip. "Am I dreaming? Can I believe
what I see? Say, Matt, this is too blamed good
to be true!"</p>

<p>Matt, getting quick control of his wits, had been
running his eyes over the roadster. One of the rear
tires was flat. On the ground near the flattened tire
lay a new one, just taken out of the brackets that had
supported it.</p>

<p>"Well, well, this <i>is</i> luck!" breathed Matt, getting off
his machine and hurrying to the automobile. "A tire
blew up on them. They haven't a jack along, and
they've gone into the brush to cut a couple of pieces of
ironwood, in order to lift the axle and get on a new
tire."</p>

<p>"They may be back&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure, and we've got to hustle." Matt was already on
the running-board. "Here are our canteens," he went
on excitedly, picking both of the gasoline-cans out of
the rumble. "And they're full, too," he added. "Take
one, Clip, and empty it into your gasoline-tank."</p>

<p>It was a time for action rather than words. The chopping
had ceased in the chaparral, but the talking was
still going on, and, from the sound of it, the two men
were not as yet coming any nearer.</p>

<p>"We're using up our reserve supply," said Clip, while
they were emptying the canteens into the tanks.</p>

<p>"We'll fill the canteens again out of the car-tank," returned
Matt, "if we have time."</p>

<p>"Bully!" chuckled Clip. "Then let the rest of the
gasoline out into the road. Give 'em a dose of their
own medicine. It'll serve 'em right."</p>

<p>Clip was a lad of quick temper. The Indian blood in
his veins undoubtedly lay at the root of this, but the
resentment he felt at being looked down upon by some
of the Ph&oelig;nix boys who regarded the mixed blood as
a taint had had a good deal to do with it.</p>

<p>Had Matt not interfered at the well, Clip would certainly
have set upon Gregory, for rarely did Clip's
temper allow him time to reason a matter out. This reprisal
against the two men who had the roadster, however,
had already taken form in Matt's mind before Clip
had suggested it. By stranding the car in the desert,
thirty-five miles from a gasoline-filling station, Matt
could clip the claws of his enemies and render them
harmless.</p>

<p>The moment the <i>Comet's</i> tank had been filled and
capped, Matt carried the canteen to the motor-car and
proceeded to replenish it out of the supply belonging
to his two enemies.</p>

<p>Then, while he was filling Clip's canteen, Clip was
busy making Matt's fast to the head of the <i>Comet</i>.
Both boys were so hard at work that they did not notice
the sound of voices had died out in the chaparral. As
Matt stepped back from the motor-car and finished
screwing the cap on the canteen, a man jumped out into
the road. The man was carrying a six-foot length of
ironwood. With a yell of anger, he hurled the heavy
stick straight at Matt.</p>

<p>Matt dodged, and the timber just grazed his head.</p>

<p>"Jem!" whooped the man; "this way&mdash;on the jump!"</p>

<p>Running around the front of the automobile, Matt
made a rush for his machine, at the same time yelling
to Clip to get into the saddle and make off with a
rush.</p>

<p>The man, darting around the rear of the roadster,
started to plant himself in Matt's way. Matt feinted
as though he would pass on the right side. When the
man had thrown himself in that direction, Matt plunged
by on the left, whirling the canteen by the strap and
striking his enemy a fierce crack on the side of the
head.</p>

<p>The man toppled over against the automobile. By
then Matt had reached the <i>Comet</i>. Still hanging to
Clip's canteen, he jerked the motor-cycle away from
the bushes, got into the saddle, and started the pedals.
Clip had already started, but was going slow and looking
back to see if his help would be needed.</p>

<p>Jem, the driver of the roadster, crashed through the
bushes just as the <i>Comet</i> was getting under its own
headway. He carried an ax and another piece of freshly
cut ironwood.</p>

<p>"That's King!" whooped Jem's companion. "Stop
him! You've got to stop him!"</p>

<p>Clip flung back a taunt. Matt, as the <i>Comet</i> gathered
speed like a mettlesome racer, wondered how Jem was
going to cover the fast-widening gap and do anything
to stop either of the motor-cycles.</p>

<p>The next moment he understood what the last resource
was the two men were going to fall back upon.</p>

<p>There came a "pop" like an exploding fire-cracker, and
a bullet whistled past Matt's ear. Bending lower over
the handlebars, he opened the throttle with a twist of
his left hand. The road was down-hill and the <i>Comet</i>
was going like a thunderbolt.</p>

<p>In about two seconds Matt had caught up with Clip;
then, in an instant more, both boys were screened from
their enemies by a turn in the road.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">SMOKE-SIGNALS.</p>


<p>"Thunder!" muttered Clip, as the breakneck pace was
slackened a little. "Just made it, Matt. By the skin
of our teeth. And we didn't dump their gasoline into
the road, either. They'll be after us just a-smoking
when they get that new tire on."</p>

<p>"We're playing in great luck, Clip, to get off as well
as we did," answered Matt. "Here, take your two
quarts of gasoline."</p>

<p>Clip took the canteen and hung the strap over his
handlebars.</p>

<p>"We're ahead now, anyway," said he, with grim satisfaction.
"That's a heap better than being behind."</p>

<p>Matt listened to the steady hum of the <i>Comet's</i> twin
cylinders with an exultation he could not conceal. What
had happened had been almost like snatching victory
from certain defeat.</p>

<p>"How much time did we lose?" asked Clip.</p>

<p>"It's two o'clock," answered Matt, juggling his watch
with one hand.</p>

<p>"And we're in the lead. That makes a heap of difference.
There'll be no underhand work ahead of us,
after this. We'll beat the news to Potter's Gap."</p>

<p>The trail slid away into the flat desert at the foot
of the slope. As the boys wheeled across the sandy
level, they cast a look backward at the brush-covered
slope, to see if they could discover any traces of the
red roadster and of their enemies.</p>

<p>The car was not in sight, but rising straight upward in
the still air was a thin column of smoke. Suddenly
the column was broken, and one, two, three balls of
vapor floated aloft; then the straight, grayish plume was
in evidence again; after a moment the smoke-balls reappeared
and wound up the spectacle.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" exclaimed Matt. "What sort of a
performance do you call that, Clip?"</p>

<p>Clipperton's face was ominous as he answered:</p>

<p>"Smoke-signals. Those two back there must belong
to Dangerfield's gang. They were telling some of the
rest of the gang that we're coming." A look of savage
pride crossed Clipperton's face. "You know why I
know," he added. "It was born in me."</p>

<p>Motor Matt had been the first true white friend Clipperton
had ever had. Perhaps that was because he had
looked for the worth and manliness in the depths of
Clip's nature, and had found more than any one else
had ever taken the trouble to hunt for. Clip's ancestry
was a raw wound, principally because there were some
who took malignant pride in never allowing it to heal;
and yet he was defiantly proud of it.</p>

<p>"I wish I had had a little of the same kind of knowledge
born in me, Clip," said Matt generously, and Clip
threw him a grateful look, and his surliness vanished.</p>

<p>"See there!" cried Clip abruptly, pointing toward a
range of dim blue hills to the north. "The signals were
read. They're being answered."</p>

<p>A long way off, but perfectly plain in the clear air,
arose a column of smoke. It was broken into little
clouds, just as the other had been, and when it disappeared
it vanished as quickly.</p>

<p>"How do they do it, Clip?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"A fire of green wood and a wet blanket. That's all.
There's Frog Tanks," and Clip indicated a cluster of
adobe walls and thatched roofs, midway between them
and the point where the answering signals had shown
themselves.</p>

<p>It was twenty minutes after two when the boys wheeled
through the little Mexican settlement. There was no
sign of the red roadster behind them, but, for all that,
they were expecting trouble on account of the smoke-signals.</p>

<p>"Two hours and five minutes on the road," cried Matt,
"and we're forty-five miles from Ph&oelig;nix. We're still
ahead of the schedule, Clip."</p>

<p>"The worst part of the road's ahead," said Clip
briefly. "Here's where we begin to strike it."</p>

<p>Just at that moment the trail dipped into a rocky
ravine and climbed a steep bank on the opposite side.
There was no water in the ravine, but the rocks were
jagged and sharp, and they had to use much care to
save their tires. With all the reserve power thrown
into the machinery, the <i>Comet</i> made hard work of the
hill. Clip had to get off and drag his motor-cycle up
by hand.</p>

<p>For a mile beyond the ravine the trail was heavy with
sand. Matt began to appreciate the difficulties ahead
of him and to worry a little about the outcome. Clip
noticed the serious look that crossed his chum's face.</p>

<p>"Don't fret," said he. "The cañon won't be as bad
as this. The bed of the cañon is hard enough. What
makes it a tough trail is the boulders brought down in
the freshets. That automobile couldn't get up the cañon
at all. You and I can go around the rocks. There's
the opening into the gulch. Just ahead."</p>

<p>At the edge of the flat Matt saw a high, rocky ridge.
The ridge was broken by a notch, and the road crawled
through the opening and into the defile.</p>

<p>The sides of the notch were steep, and the boys rode
through it in single file, Matt taking the lead. When
they were about half-way through, a crash broke on
their ears, followed by a rumbling sound that grew
swiftly in volume.</p>

<p>A yell of warning came from Clip.</p>

<p>Matt had just time to catch a glimpse of a rock
rushing down the side of the notch. In a trice he
speeded up the <i>Comet</i> and leaped forward toward the
cañon, sand and loosened pebbles dropping all around
him.</p>

<p>From behind him came a ringing shock. With his
heart in his throat he shut off the power and clamped
on the brake, stopping so suddenly that he was nearly
thrown over the front wheel.</p>

<p>When he turned to look around, the rumbling had
ceased. Clip's machine lay on its side, with a twisted
and bent rear wheel, and Clip himself was just rising
from the ground.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt, Clip?" Matt asked, bracing the <i>Comet</i>
against a boulder and running back.</p>

<p>Clip was frantic with rage and disappointment. One
look at his machine was enough to tell him that he
was out of the race.</p>

<p>"Those smoke-signals did it!" he snorted angrily,
lifting his eyes to the slope of the notch wall. "Some
one loosened a rock. The skulking coyote! It's a wonder
we weren't killed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Matt saw the stone. It was round, water-worn, and
as big as a barrel. Evidently it had caught Clip's machine
just as it was all but out of the way. The impact
had whirled it around and bent and twisted the
wheel.</p>

<p>"Nothing but a repair-shop can ever fix that," said
Matt, almost as much disappointed as his chum was.
"What'll you do, Clip?"</p>

<p>Clip did not answer. He had seen something up the
steep slope that brought a snarl of anger to his lips
and sent him clawing and scrambling up the rocks.</p>

<p>Matt ran after him. If there was to be a fight with
any of the Dangerfield gang, Matt was determined not
to let Clip go into it alone.</p>

<p>The climb was a hard one, but the hard, well-trained
muscles of the two boys made record work of it.</p>

<p>Twenty feet up the wall was a shelf. Clip was over
the edge of the shelf first, having had the lead of Matt
in the start. As Matt crawled over, he saw a roughly
dressed man scurrying to get up the wall at the back
of the shelf.</p>

<p>Clip jumped for the man, clutched his feet, and pulled
him down. A torrent of imprecations, in some unknown
tongue, burst from the man's lips. Throwing up his
hands, he caught Clip about the throat, and the two
rolled over and over, struggling desperately.</p>

<p>They would have gone over the edge of the shelf and
rolled and bounded down the wall, had not Matt, quick
to note his chum's danger, darted for the fighters to
grab and hold them back.</p>

<p>Catching the man by the shoulders, Matt flung him
sideways, on his back. The fellow had a knife in his
hand, and made a vicious stab at Matt's breast. Clip,
by a quick movement of his lithe body, caught the man's
wrist and held the weapon back. Then, while all three
were on their knees on the rocky shelf, a strange scene
was enacted. Clip and the man stared at each other
with startled eyes. The fight went out of each of them
in a flash. An expression of amazement crept into
their faces, and along with Clip's astonishment came a
tinge of bitterness.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" queried Matt, getting to his feet.</p>

<p>Neither Clip nor the man spoke a word. There was
a clatter as the knife dropped on the shelf.</p>

<p>The man was tall and wiry. His face was even more
swarthy than Clip's, his eyes were small and piercing,
his hair was straight and black, and there were rings in
his ears. He wore moccasins and buckskin leggings, and
a dingy-blue flannel shirt, open at the throat.</p>

<p>Both the man and Clip got up slowly.</p>

<p>"<i>Tio! Tio mio!</i>" said Clip, in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>A slow grin worked its way into the man's face.
From the edge of the shelf he looked down to where
the disabled motor-cycle was lying.</p>

<p>Then he said something in a language Matt could
not understand, and took a step toward Clip, with hand
outstretched. Clip muttered and struck the hand aside.
The man did not appear very much cast down by this
lack of courtesy, but bent over coolly and picked up his
knife. Returning it to his belt, he folded his arms,
leaned back against the wall at the other side of the
shelf, and studied the two boys curiously.</p>

<p>Clip clenched his hands as some strong emotion swept
through him. Then abruptly he stepped toward the man
and began speaking. What he said Matt could not
understand. The words came swiftly, fairly tripping
over each other. That Clipperton was upbraiding the
man there was no doubt; but why he should do that,
or why either of them should act in the queer manner
they were doing was a puzzle.</p>

<p>Clip's fierce words seemed to make an impression on
the man. The grin faded from his lips and a more
serious expression took its place. As soon as he could
break into the torrent of Clip's talk, the man spoke.
He spoke for a full minute, and Matt pricked up his
ears as he heard the name of Dangerfield mentioned.</p>

<p>When the man had finished, Clip said something in a
sharp tone and started down the slope, beckoning Matt
to follow. The man came to the edge of the shelf and
watched them as they slipped and scrambled to the
trail, but he made no move to follow.</p>

<p>"Smoke-signals," said Clip, in his usual terse fashion.
"They got us into this fix. And brought me a big surprise.
But it may be a help to you, Matt, in the long
run."</p>

<p>Clip's face was moody, although his words were
spirited enough.</p>

<p>"What in the wide world is that fellow?" queried
Matt. "What sort of a hold have you got over him,
Clip?"</p>

<p>"There's a chain of men watching Castle Creek
Cañon," said Clip, not seeming to hear Matt's question.
"The smoke-signals are passed on. From the other
side of Frog Tanks, they reach Dangerfield, at Tinaja
Wells. Some of the gang are laying for you above
here. You'll have to go on alone. Think you can find
the way?"</p>

<p>"It's right up the cañon, isn't it, until I get to the trail
that leads over the right-hand wall?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Take the first trail that leads over the wall.
You can't go wrong. While daylight lasts," and a cunning
look rose in Clip's eyes, "there'll be more smoke-signals
coming from here. I'll be back of them. <i>And
they'll help you through.</i>"</p>

<p>Clip turned and led the way to the boulder where
Matt had left the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>"You'd better hike, Matt," said he. "You can't lose
any more time."</p>

<p>"But who's that ruffian, Clip?" asked Matt again, as
he got into the saddle.</p>

<p>"That ruffian"&mdash;there was mocking bitterness in Clip's
voice, as he spoke&mdash;"is my uncle. He's a half-breed.
His name is Pima Pete. He's one of the gang. He
didn't recognize me when he rolled that stone down
the hill. We haven't seen each other for two years."</p>

<p>Clip whirled around, as though he would make off
without another word. Matt was dumfounded. He recovered
himself, however, in time to call sharply:</p>

<p>"Clip!"</p>

<p>Clipperton turned and saw Matt holding out his hand.
"Can't you say good-by, pard, and wish me luck?"
asked Matt.</p>

<p>Clipperton hesitated a moment, then rushed forward,
caught Matt's hand, and wrung it fervently. But he
could not trust himself to speak.</p>

<p>Another minute and Motor Matt was in Castle Creek
Cañon, headed north.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ON THE DIVIDE.</p>


<p>It was five minutes to three, and there were fifty
miles of cañon and up-and-down trail over the divide to
be covered. This meant that Motor Matt must average
twenty-five miles an hour for the next two hours. In
favorable parts of the trail he must do better than that,
to off-set losses of time where the going was most
difficult.</p>

<p>The bed of the cañon was strewn with boulders,
ranging in size from a bucket to a hogshead. The road
was plainly marked, but the last freshet had sprinkled
it with stones, large and small.</p>

<p>Mountain-wagons, constructed for service in such sections
of the country, were hauled over the smallest of
the boulders, and where the largest were met, and
could not be avoided by a detour, the driver of the
wagon got out and rolled them away.</p>

<p>As Clip had said, however, the trail was impassable
for automobiles. A high-wheel wagon could bump and
jerk its way over the stones, but a low-wheel car with
pneumatic tires would not have lasted half an hour in
the cañon, nor have traversed a mile of it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the narrow tread of a motor-cycle
enabled it to dodge the rocks, leaving the trail
only at points where the rocks were so close together
the machine could not get between them.</p>

<p>But sharp eyes, a firm hand, and unerring judgment
were needed for every foot of the way. This, of course,
made anything like the best speed impossible.</p>

<p>For several miles Matt weaved his way in and out,
speeding up on the comparatively clear stretches, and
slowing down for places where the most obstacles were
encountered. The avoiding of sharp stones and boulders
at last became almost mechanical. With his gaze on the
road immediately in advance, his hands instinctively
turned the <i>Comet</i> right or left, as the exigencies of the
case demanded.</p>

<p>When he could spare a little of his attention from the
running of the machine, his thoughts reverted to Clipperton
and his heart saddened with the hurt pride
smoldering in Clip's eyes when they had parted in the
notch.</p>

<p>Clip's uncle&mdash;his mother's brother, most probably&mdash;was
a half-breed and a member of Dangerfield's gang. How
Clip's sensitive soul must have recoiled from confessing
the truth to Matt! And yet Clip had been manly
enough to face the issue, and Matt liked him all the
better for it.</p>

<p>"What a fellow's people are," thought Matt, "don't
amount to a picayune; it's what the fellow is himself
that counts. But it was tough on Clip to run into a
relative and find him passing smoke-signals along for
that prince of rascals, Dangerfield. And then, it was
pretty near the last straw to have that relative roll a
stone down the bank and put Clip out of the running.
I don't blame him for getting worked up."</p>

<p>A study of the speedometer showed Matt that he
was not averaging more than twenty miles an hour.
This worried him. The necessity for doing better than
that was vital to the success of his mission, and yet,
without great risk to his machine, he did not see how
he was going to accomplish it. Hoping constantly for
a better piece of road, he pushed doggedly on.</p>

<p>The walls of the cañon were wide apart and high.
They formed themselves into pinnacles, and turrets, and
parapets, and a fanciful mind could easily liken them
to the walls of a castle. From these features of the
cañon it had, no doubt, derived its name of "Castle
Creek."</p>

<p>A stream flowed through the defile, but a stranger
would not have discovered this from a casual survey
of the cañon's bed. The stream was like most water-courses
in Arizona, and flowed <i>under the sand</i> and next
to the bed-rock. Here and there, at irregular intervals,
the water appeared in pools, pushed to the surface by
a lifting of the underlying rock.</p>

<p>Once Matt halted to snatch a drink from one of the
diminutive ponds, but in less than a minute he was
astride the <i>Comet</i> again and pushing resolutely onward.</p>

<p>Here and there he passed a "flat," or level stretch of
earth, brought down by the waters from above and
lodged in some bend of the gulch. These flats were
free from stones and covered with a scant growth of
cottonwoods and piñons.</p>

<p>Some time was gained by riding across these level, unobstructed
stretches.</p>

<p>A little more than half an hour after leaving the
notch, Matt passed a flat that lay at the foot of a gully
running into the ravine. There was an adobe house
on the flat, a corral, and other evidences of a rather
extensive ranch. A man was standing in front of the
house as Matt hurried past. He was staring at the
motor-cycle like a person in a trance.</p>

<p>"What place is this?" called Matt, as he went by.</p>

<p>"Hot Springs," the rancher called back. "What sort
of a contraption y'u got thar, anyways?"</p>

<p>Matt told him, but probably the backwoodsman was
not very much enlightened.</p>

<p>North of Hot Springs the road was tolerably clear
for several miles, and the <i>Comet</i> leaped along it at
top speed. When near the end of the good going,
the road forked, a branch entering a gap in the right-hand
wall and climbing steeply toward the top.</p>

<p>Matt's heart gave a bound.</p>

<p>"Here's where I take the divide!" he muttered,
swerving the <i>Comet</i> into the opening and giving it every
ounce of power for the climb. "Now for Potter's Gap
and Sheriff Burke."</p>

<p>Up and up went the trail, twisting back and forth in
long horseshoe curves. But for those curves, no wagon
could ever have scaled that frightful ascent. In places
the road had seemingly been blasted out of a sheer
wall, and it was so narrow that a wagon would have
had to rub against the cliff-face in order to keep the
opposite wheels from slipping over the dizzy brink.</p>

<p>Matt's view of the cañon and of the surrounding
hills opened as he ascended. He had not much time
for the view, however, for when he was not peering
at the trail, or catching a look at the face of his watch,
he was studying the speedometer. It was after four
o'clock, and he was making barely four miles an hour!</p>

<p>Higher and higher he climbed, coming steadily nearer
to the top of the divide. A light breeze fanned his
face, and all around him he could see mountain peaks
pushing upward into the clear blue sky. Only the
<i>chug-chug</i> of his laboring motor-cycle broke the stillness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Probably never before, since time began, had
those hills echoed with the puffing of a steel horse.</p>

<p>At last the climbing trail dipped into a level tangent
just below the top of the mountain. After a straight-away
run of a hundred yards, it coiled serpentlike around
the mountain's crest.</p>

<p>On Matt's left was a broken granite wall running
vertically to the top of the peak; on his right was a
chasm, falling hundreds of feet into a gloomy gulch.
Between the chasm and the wall ran the ribbon of road,
eroded in places by wind and weather until it had a
perceptible slant outward.</p>

<p>A skidding of the wheels, the relaxation for an instant
of a cool, steady grip on the handlebars, or a
sudden attack of dizziness would have hurled the young
courier into eternity.</p>

<p>In that hazardous place speed was not to be thought
of. "Slow and sure" had to be Matt's motto. He
finished the tangent and began rounding the curve. In
no place on that fearsome bend was the road visible for
more than a dozen feet ahead.</p>

<p>While he was avoiding the fissures, and carefully picking
his way around the curve, a savage growl broke
suddenly on his ears. With racing pulses, he lifted his
eyes and saw a huge dog crouching in the path before
him.</p>

<p>The dog was a Great Dane, big enough and seemingly
savage enough for a bear. While Matt stared, and wondered
how and why the dog happened to be there, a
man in a blue shirt, sombrero, and with trousers tucked
in his boot-tops, emerged suddenly from behind a shoulder
of rock. He carried a club, and a look of intense
satisfaction crossed his face as he came in sight
of Matt.</p>

<p>"Take him, Bolivar!" yelled the man, and Motor Matt
was brought suddenly face to face with unexpected
peril.</p>

<p>With a vicious snarl, the dog lifted his great body
into the air and plunged toward the <i>Comet</i>. Matt had
come to a quick stop, disengaging his right foot from
the toe-clip and bracing the motor-cycle upright. He
had time for no more than to throw his left arm over
his face, when the dog struck him.</p>

<p>The impact of the brute's body was terrific. Matt
went down, with the motor-cycle on top of him, head
and shoulders over the brink of the precipice.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A RUSE THAT WON.</p>


<p>Of course, the smoke-signals, passed along by Dangerfield's
chain of guards, were responsible for Matt's predicament.
The man and the dog were at that difficult
place in the trail to capture the governor's courier, and
just at that moment it looked as though they had succeeded.</p>

<p>Unarmed as he was, what could Motor Matt accomplish
against the ruffian and the dog? This problem
rushed through the boy's brain as he lay at the edge of
the trail.</p>

<p>The Great Dane, crouching close and snarling, watched
him as a cat watches a mouse. Matt stared into the
brute's fiendish little eyes, and reason told him that the
bared white fangs would instantly fasten upon his throat
if he moved.</p>

<p>He was not injured, although somewhat bruised, and
his mind was as keen and alert as ever. Why not, he
asked himself, "play possum" with the man and the dog,
and pretend to be badly hurt and unconscious? The
ruse might not help him any, but there was a chance
that it would.</p>

<p>Closing his eyes until he could just see through them
and keep track of what was going on, he held his breath,
lay silent, and watched.</p>

<p>The man drew close, leaned on his club, and stood
looking down.</p>

<p>"Hello, thar, young feller!" he called.</p>

<p>Matt did not answer.</p>

<p>"Hello, I say!" repeated the man, nudging Matt with
the end of the club. "I reckon you're the one Bolivar
an' me's been waitin' here fer, an'&mdash;what's the matter
with ye, anyhow?"</p>

<p>Still no answer from Matt.</p>

<p>"Must hev hit his head a crack when he went down,"
muttered the man. "You're some sizeable, Bolivar, an'
when ye fall on anythin', ye come down like a thousand
o' brick. Git away from him! I reckon ye've done
yore part. I'll get a rope on him now. Clear out!"</p>

<p>The dog slunk away along the road to a distance of
two or three yards. Then the man pulled the <i>Comet</i>
away and leaned it against the rocks.</p>

<p>"Fust time I ever seen one o' them steel bronks," he
remarked, talking to himself. "Pussonly, I ain't got no
use fer a hoss that drinks gasoline. They'd be hard ter
ride, an' I don't reckon they'd be reliable."</p>

<p>Before picking up the machine, the man had dropped
his club. He now laid hold of Matt and drew him
away from the brink of the precipice. When he finally
let loose of Matt, Matt's hand was close to the small
end of the club&mdash;one arm, in fact, was lying upon it.</p>

<p>"If Bolivar had knocked ye a couple o' feet farther,
young feller," pursued the man, still talking to himself
more than to Matt, "ye'd hev tumbled inter the
gulch, iron hoss an' all. Now, we'll see what ails ye,
an' then I'll make a stagger ter git ye ter Tinaja Wells,
so Dangerfield an' the rest kin size ye up an' find out
what yer bizness is."</p>

<p>Bolivar, who did not seem to relish taking a back
seat just as his prey had come under his paws, began
growling and dragging himself forward.</p>

<p>The man turned and, with a savage oath, ordered the
animal to keep away. While his back was toward him,
Matt knew that then, if ever, was his time to bolt.</p>

<p>Like lightning the boy gained his feet, lifting the
club with him. In two leaps he was beside the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>Hearing his quick movements, the man faced around
with a frantic yell.</p>

<p>"No, ye don't!" he roared, and flung at Matt with
his bare hands.</p>

<p>The club whirled and Matt brought it down on the
man's shoulder with all his strength. It was a glancing
blow, but it was enough to daze the man and send
him reeling backward.</p>

<p>Matt lost not an instant in dropping the club, getting
astride the <i>Comet</i>, and starting. Just as the motor got
busy, the dog dropped beside Matt, gripping his right
sleeve and tearing a piece out of the stout leather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy reeled under the shock, but he was not again
overturned. To get away from the man and the dog
he must have speed, and he must set the <i>Comet</i> to
going its best in spite of the perils of the trail.</p>

<p>As he tore around the curved course, his resolute eyes
following the path in front of the machine, he heard
the snarling of the dog and the patter of his cushioned
feet on the rocks.</p>

<p>The loss for an instant of the control of the machine
would have spelled death for Motor Matt. To keep
the <i>Comet</i> away from the edge of the cliff, and away
from the loose stones fringing the wall on the other
side of the road, was the problem with which Matt had
to contend. It was a hair-raising problem, too, and
called for every ounce of nerve and every particle of
skill the boy possessed.</p>

<p>He dared not look behind to note the situation in that
quarter. The man, he knew, he could easily distance,
and it was the bounding Great Dane he feared.</p>

<p>His ears told him that the dog was holding his own&mdash;exerting
all his power and neither gaining nor losing.
But he was too close for comfort. Should he snap at
the rear wheel and puncture the tire&mdash;Matt's thoughts
could not carry the danger further. A good many
things, just then, swung in the scales of chance, and
what the dog might do was only one of them.</p>

<p>A minute passed, a minute so full of peril that it
seemed like an hour, and the darting <i>Comet</i> reached the
other side of the peak and passed from level ground to
a steep descent.</p>

<p>Below him, Motor Matt could see the trail, winding
in steep horseshoes just as on the other side of the
mountain. But there was no precipice at its edge to
threaten destruction.</p>

<p>By its own weight the machine would have coasted
down the mountain at a clip never before equaled.
Matt diminished the power that fed the racing pistons,
but still he continued to drop like a thunderbolt down
the steep slope.</p>

<p>The wind sang in his ears, and rock, bush, and
stunted tree flashed by like so many missiles hurled at
him by a giant hand. The speedometer could register up
to sixty-five miles an hour, but the needle had gone out
of business. If Motor Matt was not doing a good
seventy an hour, on that hurricane drop toward the
mountain's foot, he was far afield in his reckoning.</p>

<p>It could hardly be called a ride. It was more like a
fall through space.</p>

<p>Naturally, such a fierce gait could not last long. Matt
was at the base of the mountain before he fairly realised
it, and the <i>Comet</i> was plunging away on a mesa toward
a V-shaped cut in a ridge.</p>

<p>He had time now for a quick look rearward. The
Great Dane was not in sight. All Motor Matt had to
show for the perilous encounter on the cliffside was
his torn sleeve, a few bruises, and an uncomfortable remembrance.</p>

<p>As if to make up for the worrisome struggle through
the cañon and the snail's pace toward the top of the
divide, Matt had now a fine, hard road under him and
plenty of room.</p>

<p>How much time he had lost he did not know, but
that down-grade had put his schedule many minutes to
the good. He was going a mile a minute now, and he
was still gaining on the miles lost in the cañon.</p>

<p>As he closed in on the V-shaped opening in the ridge,
he slowed down, to make a preliminary survey of the
country ahead. The road led on through the bottom of
the "V," and Matt suddenly took note of a man on
horseback, directly in front of the charging <i>Comet</i>. The
horse, frightened by the motor-cycle, was bucking and
leaping sideways at the roadside.</p>

<p>"What place is this?" shouted Matt, as he swung past.</p>

<p>"Potter's Gap!" answered the man.</p>

<p>The boy's heart gave a bound, and he shut off and
stopped the <i>Comet</i> within a dozen yards. Facing about,
he waited for the horseman to spur his prancing mount
closer.</p>

<p>"That's another o' them darned new-fangled machines
that folks keep inventin'," remarked the man. "Where'd
ye come from, kid, an' what's yer bloomin' hurry? The
way ye was shootin' along, it looked as though ye'd git
to where ye was goin' purty nigh before ye started.
Whoa, blast ye!" he added to his horse. "If I had
time, I'd make ye eat oats off'n that two-wheeled thing-um-bob."</p>

<p>"My name's King," said Matt. "Can you tell me
where I'll find Sheriff Burke, of Prescott?"</p>

<p>"You bet I can! Go right around that projectin' rock
an' ye'll be in our camp. What ye lookin' up Burke
fer?"</p>

<p>Matt did not stop to answer. Turning his machine
the other way, he sped on around a projecting spur of
the ridge, and found himself among a dozen men and
horses.</p>

<p>The men were all armed, booted, and spurred. The
camp had been pitched beside a spring, and some were
watering their horses, and others were rolling up their
blankets. Matt's sudden appearance drew the attention
of all, and there was a chorus of wondering exclamations
as he brought his machine to a halt.</p>

<p>"Blamed if here ain't one o' them new kind o' bicycles!"
cried one of the men. "Slid right in on us
afore we suspected a thing! It kain't be this kid's one
o' the Dangerfield gang?"</p>

<p>A tall, broad-shouldered, red-whiskered man pushed
through the crowd that was gathering about Matt.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" the man asked sharply.</p>

<p>"I'm looking for Sheriff Burke," replied Matt.</p>

<p>"Then you've made a bull's-eye, first crack out of
the box. I'm Burke."</p>

<p>"What time is it, Mr. Burke?" asked Matt, getting
out of the saddle and standing beside the machine.</p>

<p>"What's that got to do with it?" demanded the Prescott
man, staring.</p>

<p>"Why, I was told to get here at five o'clock&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ye was, hey?" asked one of the posse, looking at a
watch. "Then ye're ahead of time, my boy. It lacks
five minutes of five."</p>

<p>Matt's delight must have been reflected in his face,
for Burke's interest in him manifestly deepened.</p>

<p>"Who told you to get here by five o'clock?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Governor Gaynor."</p>

<p>"Gaynor?" repeated the sheriff.</p>

<p>"Yes. I left Ph&oelig;nix at quarter-past twelve&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Last night?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;at noon to-day."</p>

<p>"An' you've come a hundred miles in five hours on
<i>that</i> thing?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>The bystanders were astonished. Not only that, but
their respect for the <i>Comet</i> visibly increased.</p>

<p>"What's the governor got to say?" proceeded Burke.</p>

<p>Matt took the letter out of his pocket.</p>

<p>"Read that, Mr. Burke," replied Matt, "and it will
tell you. Don't throw away the envelope. Just write
on the back of it, 'Received at five minutes of five, Thursday
afternoon and sign your name. I want to take it
back and show it to the governor."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">AT POTTER'S GAP.</p>


<p>All those rough and ready men were amazed at Motor
Matt's performance. Their interest in the boy and his
machine, however, was pushed to the background by
their curiosity to learn what sort of a message the
governor had sent to Burke.</p>

<p>The sheriff read the message through, then slapped
the letter excitedly with the back of his hand.</p>

<p>"Here's a go and no mistake, boys!" he cried. "The
governor and McKibben have picked up a hot clue about
that Dangerfield outfit. If Motor Matt, here, hadn't
got this message through in the time he did, the smugglers
would have got away from us."</p>

<p>"How's that, Burke?" asked the man Matt had met
in the gap, riding forward and joining the rest of the
posse.</p>

<p>"First off," Burke explained, "Juan Morisco has been
nabbed in Ph&oelig;nix. He was getting out of town with a
wood-hauler, but he had been acting queer, and McKibben
was having him watched. While in Ph&oelig;nix,
Morisco wore a piece of courtplaster on one side of his
face. The wood-hauler's team ran away, just as he
and Morisco were leaving Ph&oelig;nix, and, in the excitement
of catching it, the courtplaster must have got
knocked off Morisco's face. Anyhow, when McKibben
saw him after the team was stopped, there was that
cross-shaped scar, plain as anything. That was all McKibben
needed to see. Morisco was taken to jail, and
it was what McKibben got out of him that concerns
<i>us</i>."</p>

<p>"What in thunder was Juan Morisco doin' in Ph&oelig;nix?"
queried one of the men. "I thought he was with
Dangerfield, an' movin' this way, on the road to Mexico."</p>

<p>"Morisco told McKibben," went on Burke, "that
Dangerfield sent him on an important piece of work.
He also told McKibben that the smugglers are rounded
up at Tinaja Wells, and that they have heard we're waiting
for them at Potter's Gap, and that they're going to
leave the Wells to-night, give us the slip, and go south
by way of the Rio Verde."</p>

<p>This revelation caused a tremendous amount of excitement,
all the men talking back and forth.</p>

<p>"How'd Dangerfield ever find out we was layin' fer
him here?" asked one.</p>

<p>"The governor don't say anything about that; but
Dangerfield must know it, or Morisco wouldn't have
been able to tell McKibben. The governor says," proceeded
Burke, glancing at the letter which he still held
in his hand, "that Morisco tells McKibben Dangerfield
is going to leave Tinaja Wells to-night, but that he&mdash;the
governor, mind you&mdash;hopes to get this letter into
my hands by five o'clock this afternoon, so we'll have
a chance to rush the smugglers at the Wells by daylight."
He folded up the letter and shoved it into his
pocket. "It's twenty miles to the Wells, my lads, and
if we start at once we can make it. Saddle up in a
hurry. One of you make my horse ready."</p>

<p>Instantly the camp became a scene of bustle and
excitement. While the men were making ready, Burke
turned to Matt.</p>

<p>"I don't know how you ever got through in the time
you did, King," he observed. "That machine of yours
must be a jim-dandy."</p>

<p>"It's the best ever," answered Matt.</p>

<p>"Tell me about your trip&mdash;just the main points."</p>

<p>Matt began with the red roadster and the trouble he
had had with the two men who were traveling in it.</p>

<p>"Dangerfield has a heap of friends through this part
of the country," commented Burke. "There's a whole
lot of people, you know, who don't think smuggling
Chinks into the United States is very much of a crime.
Dangerfield must have been expecting something to go
crossways in Ph&oelig;nix and had some of his misguided
friends watching McKibben. But go ahead."</p>

<p>Matt told about the smoke-signals, and how they were
passed on along the rim of Castle Creek Cañon. The
stern lines deepened in the sheriff's face.</p>

<p>"Dangerfield was sure doing everything he could to
make a safe getaway into Mexico," said he. "They say
he has fifteen men, whites and half-breeds, working his
underground railroad. I'm willing enough to believe
about those smoke-signals. The two in the red automobile
sent word ahead that you and your chum were
coming. Well, did that make any trouble for you,
King?"</p>

<p>Matt told about the boulder which had been rolled
down the side of the notch, and which had crippled
Clipperton's machine and put him out of the running;
but he did not say a word about the half-breed.</p>

<p>The sheriff was deeply interested in Matt's recital.
By that time the rest of the men had finished getting
ready, and were pushing around Matt and listening to
his experiences. As he went on with the incident on
the divide, and the way he had escaped from the man
and the dog, several rough hands reached over to give
him an admiring tap on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"You're the stuff, son!" cried one of the men.</p>

<p>"You're a fair daisy, an' no mistake!" added another.</p>

<p>"If we clean up on the Dangerfield gang, it will be
you as helped more'n anybody else," dropped in a third.</p>

<p>"Some o' us, Burke," suggested a fourth, "mout lope
acrost the divide an' down the cañon, gatherin' in all
them outposts. Each one means a thousand apiece."</p>

<p>"By the time you got there, Meagher," returned the
sheriff, "you wouldn't find any of the men, so it would
be a bad play. Besides, we're liable to need our whole
force over at Tinaja Wells. What are you going to do,
my boy?" he asked, turning to Matt.</p>

<p>"I'm going back to Ph&oelig;nix," replied Matt.</p>

<p>"Take my advice, and don't try it to-night. It will
be dark on the divide before you could get over it, and
it's a ticklish enough place in broad day, say nothing
of trying to cover the trail when you can't see where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
you're going. I'll leave a blanket here for you to sleep
on, and a bottle of cold coffee, some crackers, and a
hunk of 'jerked.' You can get an early start in the
morning, and probably poke this envelope into the governor's
hands at noon."</p>

<p>Fishing the stump of a lead-pencil out of his pocket,
Burke wrote a few words on the back of the envelope
that had contained the governor's message, and gave it
to Matt.</p>

<p>"Before I leave, son," went on the sheriff, taking
Matt's hand, "let me say that I think you're the clear
quill. You've done a big thing to-day, and if you hadn't
had more pluck and ginger than common, it's a cinch
you'd have lost out. Now it's up to us, and if we can
make good, as you did, everything will be all serene."</p>

<p>Burke turned away and jumped into his saddle. The
rest of the men also shook Motor Matt's hand, and then
got on their horses.</p>

<p>"There's the blanket," called Burke, tossing a roll in
front of Matt. "<i>Adios</i>, my lad, and always remember
that Burke, of Prescott, is your friend. Spurs and
quirts, boys!"</p>

<p>Away dashed the posse, Burke in the lead. They
vanished in the direction of the Gap, although their road
to Painted Rocks and Tinaja Wells was not to take
them over the divide.</p>

<p>Matt was tired, and the prospect of a rest appealed
to him mightily. With a cloth taken from his toolkit,
he proceeded to dust off the <i>Comet</i>, and to look it
over and make sure it had suffered no damage. He attended
to this before he looked after his own comfort.</p>

<p>After finishing with the machine, he spread out the
sheriff's blanket under some bushes near the spring, and
ate a supper of jerked beef and crackers and drank
the bottle of coffee.</p>

<p>A feeling of relief and satisfaction ran through him.
He had finished his "century" run and had delivered the
governor's message to Burke on time. Now, if only
Clip had been with him, his enjoyment would have been
complete.</p>

<p>He fell to wondering what Clip was about, and how
he had expected to help with his smoke-signals. It
would have been easy for Clip, aided by the half-breed,
to send signals along the line carrying information that
the trouble was over with. But Clip had not been
able to do that, or the encounter would not have occurred
on the divide.</p>

<p>While Matt's mind circled about his chum, darkness
fell suddenly, as it always does in Arizona, and coyotes
began to yelp shrilly among the hills. Feeling perfectly
secure, Matt lay back, pulled the side of the blanket
over him, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>He must have slept several hours, when he was
aroused by a rustling in the bushes near him, and a
sound as of some animal sniffing about his camp. Reaching
for the bottle that had contained the coffee, he threw
it into the brush. There followed a yelp, and the animal&mdash;coyote
or wolf&mdash;could be heard scurrying away.</p>

<p>Getting up, Matt walked down to the spring and took
a drink. As he lifted himself erect, far off across the
hills toward the north and west he saw a fiery line rise
in the air and burst into a dozen flaming balls. Perhaps
a minute later the rocket was answered by another,
off to the south.</p>

<p>"There's a whole lot going on in these hills to-night,"
thought Matt, returning to his blanket. "By this time,
I guess, Burke and his men must have reached Tinaja
Wells and done their work there. The smuggling of
Chinks across the Mexican border is getting a black eye
in this part of the country, all right."</p>

<p>Once more Matt fell asleep. When he was aroused
again it was by a sound of voices close at hand. He
started up quickly, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.</p>

<p>Morning had come, and in the gathering light he
looked through the bushes and off toward the spring.
Two men were standing by the pool, one an American
and the other a Mexican. They were both travel-stained
and looked as though they had been doing
some hard riding.</p>

<p>The American was dressed after the fashion prevailing
in the hills, and had a couple of revolvers dangling at
his hips. Each man had a horse, and the animals looked
worn and tired.</p>

<p>Matt wondered who the two travelers could be, for
he could not remember having seen either of them
among the sheriff's men. As he gave the Mexican more
critical attention he was amazed to discover that he was
the wood-hauler who had fled from Ph&oelig;nix at the time
McKibben had arrested Juan Morisco.</p>

<p><i>This</i> was a disquieting discovery, and Matt thought
that if he could levant without being seen it would be
well for him to do so. The <i>Comet</i> was not far away,
and Matt got on his knees and began crawling toward it.</p>

<p>A bit of brush snapped under him, however, and
startled exclamations escaped the two men. Matt sprang
up, with the intention of making a run for the motor-cycle,
but before he had taken two steps, an authoritative
voice shouted: "Halt!"</p>

<p>Over his shoulder he could see that the American
was pointing a revolver at him. Matt halted, of course.
There was no reason in the world why the two men
should interfere with him, and now that he had been
unable to slip away unnoticed he faced them boldly.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">JOE BASCOMB.</p>


<p>As Motor Matt walked toward the man with the
leveled revolver, the wood-hauler cried out a startled
"<i>Madre mia!</i>" and gave a jump for the other man's arm.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, José?" demanded the
American, keeping his eyes on Matt as he talked.</p>

<p>José launched into a torrent of Spanish. Matt could
not understand a word of what he was saying, any
more than he could understand the talk which Clip
had had with his uncle, the half-breed, but the change
that came over the face of the American was remarkable.</p>

<p>In the American's eyes there was a look like that in
the orbs of a cornered panther. He had fine features&mdash;features
that told of an iron will and a fearless spirit;
nevertheless, they had a gloomy cast. While José spoke,
something akin to kindness crept through the hard,
somber lines, the lips twitched and the eyes softened.
The man lowered his revolver, tucked it away in the
swinging holster, and turned to José.</p>

<p>Then, in the same language José had used, he spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
rapidly and at considerable length. Matt stood and
waited, trying to guess what the wood-hauler had said
to cause such a change in the man's bearing.</p>

<p>"Who are you, my lad?" inquired the man civilly
enough.</p>

<p>"That's a fair question, all right," returned Matt;
"but you might have asked it before you went through
all those motions with the gun. And then, too, I don't
know why I should talk about myself until I learn a
little about you."</p>

<p>"That's straight, anyhow," said the man. "I like a
fellow that comes out flat footed and says what he thinks.
My name's Joe Bascomb, and I belong with Burke's
crowd."</p>

<p>"You wasn't with Burke's crowd when I saw them
here yesterday afternoon."</p>

<p>"No more I wasn't. Yesterday afternoon, you see,
I was on detached duty. But I was in at the skirmish
at the Wells!"</p>

<p>Bascomb frowned, as though the memory was not
pleasant.</p>

<p>"There was a fight?" Matt asked eagerly. "Were
Dangerfield and his gang captured?"</p>

<p>"There wasn't much of a fight. You see, the smugglers
weren't expecting trouble, and Burke took them
by surprise. A few shots were fired, mainly by Burke
and his men, but they went wild. The smugglers were
making for their horses. Six of their number were
captured, but a few more got away. Among those who
escaped was Dangerfield. I'm trying to get to Ph&oelig;nix
on business, and I wonder if five hundred dollars would
tempt you to let me have that wheel?"</p>

<p>Bascomb pulled a roll of bills from his pocket as he
spoke, and held it up for Matt to look at.</p>

<p>"Can you ride a wheel?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Never rode one in my life!"</p>

<p>"Then you couldn't use the motor-cycle. You'd go
off the trail on the divide as sure as fate."</p>

<p>"Bring the machine down here and let me look at it."</p>

<p>Matt rolled the <i>Comet</i> down. After Bascomb had
studied it a while he shook his head disappointedly.</p>

<p>"I reckon you're right," he muttered. "What did
you say your name was?"</p>

<p>"Matt King."</p>

<p>"Then you're the chap who covered the trail between
Ph&oelig;nix and Potter's Gap yesterday afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, Matt, I've got to get to Ph&oelig;nix as soon as
I can, and if you're not in very much of a hurry, I'll
climb into my saddle and we'll go together. If&mdash;&mdash;"
Bascomb hesitated. "If any of Dangerfield's scattered
gang happened to waylay me, there's something I'd like
to have you do for me in Ph&oelig;nix. That's why I'd like
to have you along."</p>

<p>"If you're waylaid, Mr. Bascomb," said Matt, "they'd
be liable to get me, too. Dangerfield and his men aren't
feeling any too friendly toward me after what I did yesterday
afternoon."</p>

<p>"No, they wouldn't get you," insisted Bascomb. "You
could run away from 'em like a streak on that motor-cycle.
If I ask you to do anything for me," he added
significantly, "I'll pay you well for it."</p>

<p>"All right," said Matt, "we'll travel together."</p>

<p>Bascomb turned to José, and again spoke to him in
Spanish. The Mexican immediately pulled off his
ragged slouch-hat and his tattered coat. Removing his
own hat and coat, Bascomb put on the Mexican's; then,
after transferring his personal belongings from one garment
to the other, he turned to Matt.</p>

<p>"Not much of a disguise, is it?" he remarked. "But
maybe it's enough to keep the gang from spotting me."</p>

<p>"What's that Mexican doing here?" demanded Matt.
"He was with Juan Morisco in Ph&oelig;nix yesterday, when
Morisco was arrested. This fellow cut out a horse from
the runaway team and got away."</p>

<p>"Sure he did; and he rode all day and most of the
night to find me. We came across each other by chance,
not more than two miles from here."</p>

<p>"If he's a friend of yours," said Matt suspiciously,
"and a friend of Morisco's, why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't know Mexicans, King. José doesn't know
any more than the law allows, but I rendered him a
service once, and he's never forgotten it."</p>

<p>José, apparently paying no attention to the talk, was
putting on Bascomb's expensive Stetson, and a coat which
was infinitely better than the one he had exchanged
for it.</p>

<p>"Here's where our trails divide, José," said Bascomb,
in English, taking the roll of bills from his pocket and
stripping a bank-note from it and handing it to the
Mexican. "You've made some mighty bad mistakes, but
I give you credit for doing your best. <i>Adios.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Adios!</i>" answered José.</p>

<p>Both men mounted their horses; and when Bascomb
and Matt made off, José, on his jaded beast, sat watching
them until they got around the spur on their way
to the Gap.</p>

<p>Bascomb led the way, spurring his animal into a slow
gallop. Matt followed, accommodating the speed of the
<i>Comet</i> to the gait of the horse. The long flat was
crossed and the mountain climbed and descended&mdash;all
without mishap, and without a word of talk between
the two travelers.</p>

<p>Matt's mind was busy. To pull the wool over his
eyes was not an easy matter, and the story told by Bascomb
was figuratively speaking, too full of holes to hold
water.</p>

<p>José had been with Juan Morisco. Juan was one of
the Dangerfield gang. José would not have run from
the sheriff unless he had had a guilty conscience. Yet,
when he had run away, he had taken the trouble to ride
a hundred miles and hunt for Bascomb. Bascomb had
explained that José was indebted to him, and had
hunted him up for that reason. But that, as Matt
looked at it, was no reason at all.</p>

<p>Then what did that exchange of coats and hats
mean? Why was it necessary for an officer of the law
to disguise himself? Here, again, Bascomb's explanation
did not explain.</p>

<p>Although these reflections shattered Matt's confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
in his companion, the boy did not allow it, for the present,
to make any difference in his treatment of the man.</p>

<p>Bascomb grew talkative when they reached Castle
Creek Cañon and started over the clear stretch of road
toward Hot Springs.</p>

<p>"What became of the little girl that figured in that
runaway?" he asked. There was an eagerness in his
voice which Matt did not fail to notice. "José said you
stopped the horses, picked up the little girl, and was
going to carry her into the house when Juan Morisco
interfered. José didn't see any more, as the sheriff came
up just then."</p>

<p>"I took her into the house," answered Matt, "and
we sent for a doctor."</p>

<p>The man started in his saddle and bent his piercing
eyes on the boy.</p>

<p>"Was she as badly hurt as that?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"The doctor said he didn't think she could live."</p>

<p>"What!" Bascomb's eyes were glaring like an animal's
as they met Matt's. "No, no," he added, dropping
back in the saddle and brushing a hand across his
forehead, "it can't be. I won't believe it. You stopped
the horses, and I don't see how she could have been so
badly hurt as all that."</p>

<p>"She was tied to the 'reach' of the wagon," explained
Matt, "and the front wheels broke away from those behind
just before we got the horses stopped. The girl
was dragged for a ways. If she hadn't been tied, she
wouldn't have been hurt so bad."</p>

<p>"She's been living at José's for a month," muttered
Bascomb to himself, but in a voice loud enough for
Matt to hear, "and she could stand him, but José said
she couldn't bear Juan Morisco. It was bad business
sending Juan after her. José had to tie her to the wagon
to keep her from running off when Morisco came. But
that doctor was wrong!" and Bascomb raised his voice
and once more turned to Matt.</p>

<p>This soliloquy of Bascomb's gave Matt fresh food for
thought. Bascomb spurred his tired horse cruelly, and
they got past Hot Springs at a fairly good gait.</p>

<p>"What did the girl say?" asked Bascomb, when they
were well to the south of Hot Springs, and picking their
way among the litter of stones. "Did she say anything
about herself, or about her folks?"</p>

<p>"She wouldn't say anything about herself or her
people," replied Matt.</p>

<p>"True-blue!" muttered Bascomb huskily. "She'll pull
through&mdash;she always had grit; but I wish I was sure!"</p>

<p>A mile north of the notch Bascomb's horse fell under
him. He had been forcing the animal ahead impatiently,
and as he fell floundering to the ground over the horse's
head, he swore a fierce oath.</p>

<p>One of the revolvers had dropped out of Bascomb's
belt. Unseen by its owner, Matt picked it up.</p>

<p>Bascomb, in spite of his temper over the giving out
of the horse, knelt beside the animal and unrove the
cinches. Pulling the saddle loose, he cast it aside; then
he removed the bridle and threw it after the saddle.</p>

<p>"You served me well, you poor brute," said he, "but
not well enough."</p>

<p>He whirled away. Matt was looking at him along
the barrel of the revolver. He started back with another
oath.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" he cried. "Haven't I
got enough to torture me without&mdash;&mdash;" He bit the
words short, and glared.</p>

<p>"Take that other gun from your belt," commanded
Matt, "and throw it away. You can't fool me, Bascomb!
You're one of the Dangerfield gang. I don't think you
intended going to Ph&oelig;nix, but you're going now, whether
you want to or not!"</p>

<p>Matt's voice was steady, and his gray eyes snapped in
a way that meant business.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BOLIVAR TURNS UP.</p>


<p>"You're the last person in the world, King," said Bascomb,
with more injury than hostility in his voice, "who
ought to butt in on me like this. If you knew <i>all</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped short and pursed up his lips. His gloomy
face and haunted eyes were touched with sadness.</p>

<p>"I know enough to figure out that you're trying to
fool me," said Matt. "The yarn you told me back there
in the gap won't wash. It's my opinion, Bascomb, that
you're no more of a deputy sheriff than I am. Anyhow,
I'm going to take you to McKibben, in Ph&oelig;nix, and
give him a chance to pass judgment on you. That other
gun, if you please."</p>

<p>Bascomb thought the matter over for a moment, then
drew the revolver.</p>

<p>"Do you want it?" he asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Throw it over there in the brush," ordered Matt.
Bascomb obediently flung the weapon into the thicket.
"You're right," said he, "I'm one of the gang. I
ought to have known better than to try to fool you&mdash;you're
too keen; but I wanted to go to Ph&oelig;nix, and I
wanted you to be with me on the way, so if any of
Burke's men laid me by the heels I could get you to
transact a little honest business for me. I'm going to
town, King, and I want to get there in a rush. I'm
willing to go as your prisoner and I'll make you no
trouble, providing you take me to see that little girl
before you take me to McKibben. Is it a bargain?"</p>

<p>There was something about the man that Matt liked,
in spite of the deceit he had practised at the start-off
of their acquaintance.</p>

<p>"When a fellow has lied to you once, Bascomb," returned
Matt, "you never feel as though you could trust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
him. But I'll go you this time. I'm going to keep this
gun, though, and watch you every minute."</p>

<p>"That's not necessary, but I'm willing to have it that
way if it will make you feel any easier in your mind."</p>

<p>"What was it you were going to have me do?" went
on Matt. "I don't know as I want to mix up in any of
your lawless operations."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't ask you to do that," said Bascomb sharply.
"I can't tell whether I want you to do anything or not
until after we get to the notch. We're losing time here,"
he finished, "and I've told you I'm in a hurry to reach
town. You ought to know it's important when I'm willing
to lose my liberty in order to get there."</p>

<p>"Well," returned Matt, "start on, Bascomb. You'll
have to travel on foot, and I'll keep close behind you."</p>

<p>Without further loss of time, Bascomb swung off down
the cañon.</p>

<p>"I can pick up a horse at the Tanks," he called back,
over his shoulder, "and when we leave there we'll make
better time. We'll have to stop at the notch, but I hope
we won't have to be there long."</p>

<p>"If you're figuring on having some of the gang meet
you in the notch, and side-track me," said Matt, "I don't
think we'll stop there at all."</p>

<p>"I give you my word," protested Bascomb, "that I'm
not going to make you any trouble."</p>

<p>"Your word's not worth very much."</p>

<p>Bascomb made no answer to this, but gave his undivided
attention to the road and swung into a dog-trot.
In less than a quarter of an hour afterward he reached
the notch, Matt wheeling into it close at his heels.</p>

<p>Bascomb halted and looked around expectantly. Apparently
he did not see what he wanted to find, and he
placed his fingers on his lips and gave a shrill whistle.</p>

<p>Matt had the revolver in his hand, and as he waited
and watched his fingers closed resolutely on the stock.</p>

<p>Following the whistle, there was a sound of quick
movements up the steep wall. A form bounded off the
shelf and came tearing down the slope in the direction
of Bascomb.</p>

<p>A startled exclamation escaped Matt's lips. The newcomer
was a dog, and the dog was the Great Dane!</p>

<p>It was plain that the dog recognized Matt. As the
animal crouched at Bascomb's feet, his baleful eyes
turned in the boy's direction, and he growled menacingly.</p>

<p>"I'll shoot the brute if he comes near me!" shouted
Matt.</p>

<p>"I'll not let him touch you," answered Bascomb, stooping
to pat the dog's neck. "His recollections of you
aren't of the pleasantest, I reckon. Quiet, Bolivar!" he
added.</p>

<p>The next moment Bascomb had untied a cord from the
dog's collar and removed a note. He read the note
quickly, then tore it in fragments and threw the pieces
away. Taking a note-book from his pocket, he proceeded
to pencil some words on a leaf. Tearing out the leaf
he folded it compactly and carefully secured it to the
leather band.</p>

<p>"Clear out, Bolivar!" he cried, when he had finished.
"Off with you, old boy!" he added, and waved his hand
toward the hills.</p>

<p>The dog got up, gave a final snarl at Matt, then leaped
away. In a few moments he had whisked out of sight.</p>

<p>Matt was somewhat in doubt as to whether or not he
ought to stop this proceeding. It was dear that Bascomb
had received a communication from some of the
scattered gang, and had sent one in return. Was he
planning to help them evade Burke and his posse?</p>

<p>Bascomb must have divined what was going on in
Matt's mind, for he turned to him as soon as Bolivar
was out of sight.</p>

<p>"There was nothing lawless about that note, or the
one I sent back, King," said he. "It was private business,
entirely. Now I'm going to scribble a few lines
for you, and you can read them in a few days, or any
time after we get to Ph&oelig;nix."</p>

<p>More pencil work followed in the memorandum-book.
Another leaf was torn out, folded, and handed to Matt.
He put it into his pocket along with the envelope returned
to him by Burke.</p>

<p>The winding up of this incident seemed to give Bascomb
a good deal of relief.</p>

<p>"Now," he observed, "I'm ready for a quick trip to
Ph&oelig;nix, and for whatever happens there."</p>

<p>He whirled and started through the notch at a brisk
pace.</p>

<p>"It's not often," he continued, talking as he strode
along, "that a boy makes the hit with me that you have,
Matt. You'll find out why as soon as we get to where
we're going. How long have you been in this part of
the country?"</p>

<p>"A year," replied Matt.</p>

<p>"Where did you come from?"</p>

<p>"Albany, New York."</p>

<p>"I'd have gambled something handsome you were from
the East. I'm from New York City, myself, but I've
been knocking around these hills for two years. You
see," he added, "I'm a close friend of Dangerfield's, and
his ideas and mine, about that Chinese Exclusion Act,
are identically the same. If this is a free country, how
can we keep the Chinks out, any more than the Eskimos,
or the Dutch, or any one else that wants to come
here? There's a hundred in cold cash for every Chink
that's run across the border, and Dangerfield has been
smuggling them in in droves. He has the system worked
out fine, and there are good, reliable men at every station
on his underground line. Juan Morisco is the first
of the outfit that ever went wrong."</p>

<p>For a while, Bascomb hurried along in silence; then he
commenced talking again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"I reckon you understand, by now, how well Dangerfield
had organized his gang. There wasn't a loop-hole
he didn't have watched. Men in Ph&oelig;nix were looking
after McKibben, and the minute Morisco was jugged
they knew it; and when Morisco turned traitor and told
what he knew, they found that out, too. For more than
a year Dangerfield has been doing his work and laughing
at the authorities. But things were getting too hot
for him, and he was planning to go over into Mexico
and go to mining in Sonora. He was ready for the
dash across the border when Burke got wind of it and
went into camp at Potter's Gap, hoping to head the gang
off. Up at Tinaja Wells we knew what he was doing,
and if Dangerfield hadn't sent Juan Morisco on a special
mission to Ph&oelig;nix the lot of us would have got away
from Burke and he'd never have caught us."</p>

<p>Bascomb fell silent again, and for a mile or more he
kept up his steady, swinging gait.</p>

<p>"It was you, King," he went on, but with no malice
in his voice, "who put a spoke in Dangerfield's wheel.
If it hadn't been for you and the <i>Comet</i>, the governor
couldn't have got word to Burke before we had all
slipped past him and gotten well off toward the border.
That's the way luck will take a turn sometimes."</p>

<p>All this was information that might be used against
those of the gang who had been captured, and Matt wondered
at Bascomb's recklessness in telling it.</p>

<p>"If José had used persuasion with Ollie instead of tying
her to the wagon," Bascomb continued, with a tinge
of bitterness, "there wouldn't have been any trouble, and
Juan and José would have gotten clear. But a greaser
never does a thing like a white man. It was while José
was tying Ollie to the wagon, telling her he was doing
it just to keep her from falling off, that the team got
scared and began to run."</p>

<p>Bascomb muttered something to himself, his shoulders
heaved and his hands clenched spasmodically. Some terrible
emotion ran through him, as it had done before, and
Matt was puzzled to account for it.</p>

<p>By that time they had drawn near the descent that
led into the ravine. Before they started down, some one
sprang out into the road in front of them.</p>

<p>"Matt!" yelled a familiar voice.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" cried Matt, astounded. "What are you
doing here, Clip?"</p>

<p>"Waiting for you," answered Clip, peering at Bascomb.
"Think I was going back to Ph&oelig;nix without
finding out something about how you'd come out?
Who's this?"</p>

<p>"One of Dangerfield's gang," said Matt. "I'm taking
him in."</p>

<p>"Fine!" exclaimed Clip. "But don't go on just yet.
The red roadster is at Frog Tanks. Those two roughs
are in the <i>tienda</i>. If this is one of the gang, those two
will make us trouble."</p>

<p>"An automobile?" cried Bascomb; "at the Tanks?"</p>

<p>Clip nodded. With a leap Bascomb sprang away down
the slope.</p>

<p>"Bascomb!" shouted Matt. "Come back here!"</p>

<p>The revolver was in Matt's left hand. Before he could
do anything with it, Clip grabbed it out of his hand,
leveled it after the receding form, and pulled the trigger.
A futile <i>snap</i> followed. Again and again Clip tried to
shoot, but always with the same result.</p>

<p>"I'll get him!" said Matt resolutely.</p>

<p>But before he could start the <i>Comet</i>, Clip had caught
him and tried to hold him back.</p>

<p>"They'd kill you!" growled Clip. "Your life's worth
more'n a thousand dollars. Let him go."</p>

<p>"I'll catch him before he reaches the Tanks," answered
Matt.</p>

<p>The motor started, and Matt was dragged out of his
chum's hands.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE RED ROADSTER AGAIN.</p>


<p>Bascomb was ascending the farther slope of the ravine
as the <i>Comet</i> reached the bottom. He looked over his
shoulder at Matt, then promptly jumped into the rocks
and started for Frog Tanks cross-lots. Bascomb could
scramble and make headway up the scarred bank, but
there was no chance for the motor-cycle to follow.</p>

<p>Nonplussed, Matt came to a halt and waited for Clip
to come up with him, wheeling his crippled one-cylinder.</p>

<p>"Tough luck!" said Clip commiseratingly, "But it's
a good thing, too. It wouldn't do for you to go to the
settlement while those two men are there. They're
armed. And there's something in their guns that will go
off. How long were you driving the fellow in with that
useless piece of hardware?"</p>

<p>"Something funny about that," muttered Matt.</p>

<p>"Did you know the revolver wasn't loaded?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, the other fellow didn't." Clip chuckled.
"You're the boy to do things. Too bad you couldn't win
out on this."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Clip," said Matt, "and you'll be as
much at sea as I am. Bascomb knew that gun wasn't
loaded."</p>

<p>"He did and you didn't?" Clip's eyes widened. "Then
why did he let you drive him ahead with it?"</p>

<p>"That's where the queer part comes in. He must have
been willing to be a prisoner."</p>

<p>"Then he changed his mind. Bolted as soon as he
heard about the red roadster."</p>

<p>"That makes it all the more mysterious. Bascomb is
a mighty hard fellow to understand."</p>

<p>"Let's forget it. He's gone, Matt, and that's the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
of him. Where were you at five o'clock yesterday afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Potter's Gap!"</p>

<p>"Bully!" Clip jerked off his cap and waved it. "The
governor knew what he was doing when he got Motor
Matt to make that 'century' run. Did our smoke-signals
help?"</p>

<p>"Did you send up any?" queried Matt.</p>

<p>"Did we! Why, we started just as soon as you bolted
up the cañon. 'False alarm; everything O. K.' That's
the kind of smoke we sent up."</p>

<p>"Maybe they did help, old chap. I wasn't interfered
with until I got to the divide."</p>

<p>"Then I was of some use, after all. There were two
or three men between the notch and the divide. Tell
me all about it."</p>

<p>Matt sketched his experiences briefly. Clip's black
eyes glistened as he heard of the clash on the cliffside.
Matt followed on down and told of meeting Bascomb
and José at the gap, and of his travel Ph&oelig;nixward with
Bascomb.</p>

<p>Clip was vastly puzzled over Bascomb, just as Matt
knew he would be.</p>

<p>"If he's one of the gang," said Clip, "why is he in
such a hurry to get to Ph&oelig;nix? Why does he want to
go to Ph&oelig;nix at all? It's putting his head in the lion's
mouth."</p>

<p>"That little girl has something to do with it," declared
Matt.</p>

<p>Clip was thoughtful for a minute.</p>

<p>"Here's how I size it up," said he. "That fellow, Bascomb,
is what he said he was, at first. He's one of
Burke's men. But he didn't want to argue the case with
you. So he let you have your way. All he wanted was
to get to Ph&oelig;nix as quick as he could. He thinks Rags
can tell him something about Dangerfield and his gang.
Part of the gang's captured and part's on the run. If
Bascomb can find out quick enough, maybe some more of
'em can be nabbed."</p>

<p>Matt shook his head.</p>

<p>"I don't think you've hit it off, Clip," said he.</p>

<p>"I'll bet money or marbles I have. That red roadster'll
get Bascomb to Ph&oelig;nix in short order."</p>

<p>"If he's one of Burke's men," argued Matt, "what
will he do with the two roughs who have the machine,
and are working for Bascomb?"</p>

<p>"He'll get the best of 'em," persisted Clip. "Anyhow,
Bascomb gets the roadster. See if he don't."</p>

<p>"He's not armed, and the other two men are."</p>

<p>"Never you mind, Matt. Watch how it comes out."</p>

<p>Matt got off the <i>Comet</i> and sat down on the rocks.</p>

<p>"How long are we going to be hung up here, Clip?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Till it's safe for us to pass the Tanks. It won't be
long, now, if Bascomb gets in his work."</p>

<p>Clip braced his crippled machine up alongside the
<i>Comet</i> and dropped down beside his chum.</p>

<p>"What became of&mdash;of your uncle, Clip?" queried Matt,
after a moment.</p>

<p>It was a delicate subject, and he hated to approach it.
Still it covered a point that he felt he ought to know
about.</p>

<p>The look of hurt pride flashed into Clipperton's face.</p>

<p>"He left me last night, Matt," said he. "I couldn't
forget he was of my blood, low as he's dropped. I told
him the gang was about done for; warned him to clear
out. That's what he did. But he helped send up the
smoke-signals."</p>

<p>"You did right, exactly right," approved Matt.</p>

<p>"Fine come-down for me, though," said Clip, through
his teeth. "Nice family I've got! What's the use of
trying to be somebody? Sometimes, I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>


<p>A lawless light rose in Clip's eyes. Matt laid a
friendly hand on his knee.</p>

<p>"You've got it in you to be whatever you want to
make of yourself, pard," said he. "At least you know
who your folks are, but I don't. I know that my name's
not King, but if I'm square with myself and play the
game fair, what's the odds? I hate a chap who thinks
he's somebody just because his people amount to something;
and I'd hate a fellow just as hard who thought
he didn't amount to anything because his relatives
weren't all he'd like to have them. The thing to do is to
stand on your own feet, and that's the <i>only</i> thing!"</p>

<p>"It takes you to put heart into a fellow," returned
Clip. "You've been a mighty good friend to Tom Clipperton.
And in spite of his Indian blood. If it was
known in Ph&oelig;nix that my uncle&mdash;&mdash;" Clip gulped on
the words and did not finish.</p>

<p>"It will never be known there," said Matt.</p>

<p>"I know you'd keep still about it. If it got out in
any other way, though, I'd never set foot in the town
again."</p>

<p>"It won't get out, Clip, so let's forget it. You stayed
in the ravine to wait for me?"</p>

<p>"Sure. I wasn't going back to Ph&oelig;nix without you."</p>

<p>"You slept on the rocks?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you sleep in the gap?"</p>

<p>"What have you had to eat?"</p>

<p>"The stuff we took away from Gregory's place."</p>

<p>"There wasn't half a square meal in all of it!"</p>

<p>"I started for the Tanks, an hour ago, to get something.
Saw the red roadster in front of the <i>tienda</i> and
changed my mind."</p>

<p>Matt fished his last piece of jerked beef out of his
pocket and put it in Clip's hand.</p>

<p>"Now, regale yourself," he laughed.</p>

<p>Clip began on the meat, and while he was eating the
pounding of a motor reached their ears.</p>

<p>"The automobile!" he gasped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"And coming this way," added Matt, swerving his
eyes up the slope.</p>

<p>"The three of them are coming back," went on Clip.
"They're after us, Matt!"</p>

<p>"How do you make that out, Clip? If Bascomb is one
of Burke's men, he couldn't be coming back with two
of the Dangerfield gang. If he's coming back alone he's
unarmed, and we'll be more than a match for him."</p>

<p>"Maybe Bascomb failed to get the roadster! Maybe
the two roughs are heading this way! If&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words faded on Clip's lips. Just then the red
roadster showed itself at the top of the rise. Bascomb
was on the driver's seat and the other two men were not
in evidence.</p>

<p>Bascomb came down the slope slowly and halted the
roadster in front of the boys.</p>

<p>"All aboard for Ph&oelig;nix!" said he calmly. "One of
you get in the rumble with the machines; the other climb
up here beside me. Hurry! You know I'm in a rush,
Matt."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ON TO PHOENIX!</p>


<p>This was the biggest surprise the mysterious Bascomb
had yet sprung. Clip stared at him for a moment, with
jaws agape, then trundled his motor-cycle forward and
lifted it into the rumble. He fixed himself on the seat,
and leaned down to help Matt lift up the <i>Comet</i>.
Neither of the boys spoke&mdash;they were too bewildered.</p>

<p>"What you got in that canteen?" asked Bascomb.</p>

<p>"Gasoline," said Clip.</p>

<p>"Good enough! Hand it over here."</p>

<p>Clip unlashed the canteen and gave it to Bascomb. He
at once began emptying it into the roadster's tank.</p>

<p>"I was afraid the fuel would play out on us," remarked
Bascomb, when he had emptied the canteen, "but
now we're safe for the run to town. Are you as handy
with an automobile as you are with a motor-cycle, Matt?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I guess yes," Matt answered.</p>

<p>"Then get in behind the steering-wheel. I'm not much
good at it, and we've got to go over the line for a record.
See how quick you can get us to Ph&oelig;nix."</p>

<p>Matt went down to the foot of the hill to turn around.
When they had toiled up the bank to a level stretch, he
let the roadster out, and they went through Frog Tanks
like a red streak.</p>

<p>Jem, who had driven the car, and the other man who
had left Ph&oelig;nix with him, were sitting on the steps of the
<i>tienda</i>. They made no move to stop the car, but watched
moodily as it passed them.</p>

<p>Matt could not see Clip's face, but he knew his chum
must have been thunderstruck. Matt himself had begun
to take all these surprises as a matter of course.</p>

<p>"You thought I was running away from you, I reckon?"
said Bascomb.</p>

<p>Matt nodded.</p>

<p>"Well," went on Bascomb, "I didn't have time to explain.
I was afraid the roadster would get away before
I could reach the <i>tienda</i>."</p>

<p>"Did you have any trouble getting it?" Matt asked.</p>

<p>There was a bitter undernote in the laugh Bascomb
flung back.</p>

<p>"Why should I have any trouble?" he returned. "Those
two men are not in the gang, but they're friendly toward
Dangerfield. When I told them it was Dangerfield's
business that was taking me to Ph&oelig;nix, they were willing
I should have the machine. Who's your friend,
Matt?"</p>

<p>"My name's Tom Clipperton," said Clip, answering for
himself.</p>

<p>Bascomb started.</p>

<p>"A relative of Pima Pete?" he inquired, turning
around.</p>

<p>"What's that to you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; but it may mean a lot, one of these days,
to you and to Motor Matt."</p>

<p>There was a veiled meaning in the words, but Bascomb
was full of veiled meanings. Neither Matt nor
Clip pressed him for an explanation.</p>

<p>The power of sixty horses was tucked away under
the long hood of the roadster. All this energy was
under Matt's control. As always, whenever he had anything
to do with motors, his delight grew as their headlong
rush increased.</p>

<p>Up the slope they dashed, and past the place where
Matt and Clip had had their encounter with Jem and
the other ruffian. The little adobe at the desert well
leaped at them and fell away behind with the swiftness
of thought.</p>

<p>Three men and two horses were standing in front of
the adobe. One of the men was Gregory. The other
two were put to it to keep their horses from getting
away. Matt recognized both the horsemen as belonging
to Sheriff Burke's posse.</p>

<p>"Do you know those two with the horses?" shouted
Bascomb, in Matt's ear.</p>

<p>Matt ducked his head.</p>

<p>"And you didn't stop! A good thing for you, Motor
Matt. You're beginning to trust me a little, and you'll
not lose by it."</p>

<p>The afternoon sun was half-way down the sky. The
gray desert sparkled and gleamed in front of the roadster,
but behind it was blotted out by the dust of that
mad flight.</p>

<p>And <i>why</i> they were racing, Matt did not know. "Hit
'er up! Hit 'er up!" was the constant cry of Bascomb.</p>

<p>In the narrow seat behind, Clip lurched, and swayed,
and rattled the motor-cycles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hang on, Clip!" yelled Matt. "We don't want to
drop you off."</p>

<p>"Never mind me," roared Clip. "I'm in the seat
about half the time. On the motor-cycles the other half.
But you can't loose me."</p>

<p>They reached the Black Cañon road and went spinning
into it, some of the wheels in the air. Down the old
familiar Black Cañon road they shot, and fairly jumped
the bridge at the canal.</p>

<p>"You're a wonder, Motor Matt!" cried Bascomb
huskily. "I've seen driving, in my time, but never any
like this!"</p>

<p>"If it's speed you want&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're giving it to me! It may be a race with Death
who&mdash;who knows?"</p>

<p>Matt pondered those words as well as he could with
every faculty centered in the running of the car.</p>

<p>"You're mighty anxious to get yourself behind the
bars, Bascomb," said he.</p>

<p>"Bars!" burst out the man. "What do I care for bars
and stone walls at a time like this? Take me to the
house where you left Ollie&mdash;the shortest way."</p>

<p>"Ollie?"</p>

<p>"The little girl. Didn't she tell you her name?"</p>

<p>"She said it was 'Rags.'"</p>

<p>A groan came from Bascomb's lips.</p>

<p>"That's what it's been for the two years I've been in
Arizona. Now that everything was going to be different,
<i>this</i> had to happen. Hit 'er up, King! Can't you
do better?"</p>

<p>Every pound of power was purring in the cylinders.
No motor ever made had run as sweetly, nor hurled a
car over a road so surely and easily. The machinery
responded instantly to the slightest touch.</p>

<p>Matt's blood tingled with the joy of it all. He ceased
to bother his brain with Bascomb and his affairs, wrapping
himself completely in the noble work of the roadster.</p>

<p>It was not necessary to go through Ph&oelig;nix to reach
the McReady home. A cross-road from the Black
Cañon road would place them in the thoroughfare that
ran past the house.</p>

<p>Matt took the cross-road on two wheels, and, half a
minute later, lurched into the main thoroughfare in the
same way.</p>

<p>A horse and buggy were standing in front of the McReady
gate. Matt slowed down so as not to frighten
the horse.</p>

<p>"Why are you doing that?" asked Bascomb hoarsely.</p>

<p>Matt nodded toward the rig.</p>

<p>"We don't want to have a runaway," he answered.</p>

<p>"How much farther have we got to go?"</p>

<p>"That horse and buggy are in front of the house. They
belong to the doctor."</p>

<p>"That means," faltered Bascomb, "that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That the doctor's making a call."</p>

<p>Matt brought up the roadster beside the walk, a little
way from the horse. Bascomb was over the side of
the car before it had fairly stopped. He ran to the gate,
threw it open, and hurried along the front walk to the
porch.</p>

<p>Matt followed him as quickly as he could. He got to
the gate in time to see Welcome Perkins and Chub confronting
Bascomb at the steps.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with ye?" Welcome was demanding.
"Don't ye know we got sick folks in this house?
Ye're slammin' around like ye didn't care how much
noise ye made."</p>

<p>"Is the little girl here?" queried Bascomb, lowering
his voice.</p>

<p>"She's here, all right, but she can't be disturbed. The
doctor's in there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Matt!" exclaimed Chub, catching sight of his chum
for the first time. "Well, I wasn't expectin' to see you.
Who is this feller? Put me wise. What's the matter
with him?"</p>

<p>"He wants to see Rags," said Matt. "Let him into
the house."</p>

<p>"But she can't last long, Matt, and the doctor said
she wasn't to be disturbed."</p>

<p>Bascomb leaped up the steps, pushed Welcome and
Chub right and left with his strong arms, opened the
door, and disappeared inside the house.</p>

<p>"Shade o' Gallopin' Dick!" scowled Welcome. "That
feller acts like he owned the place. What in tarnation
ails him?"</p>

<p>Matt did not take time to answer. Stepping to the
open door, he looked in.</p>

<p>Bascomb, just over the threshold, was confronted by
the doctor and Susie.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this?" asked the doctor, in a
low tone.</p>

<p>"I want to see the girl," panted Bascomb. "This is no
time to say no to me."</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"That's nothing to you. I've got as good a right here
as anybody."</p>

<p>Bascomb hurried on to the couch. Rags, her tangled
hair lying all about her on the pillow, was lying quietly,
with closed eyes. Bascomb stumbled to his knees beside
the couch.</p>

<p>"Ollie!" he murmured. "Ollie?"</p>

<p>Matt saw the eyes open and stare upward into the
face bowed over the couch. Then, as he, and the doctor,
and Susie breathlessly watched and listened, the little
girl's arms went up and twined about the man's neck.</p>

<p>"Dad!" she murmured. "Am I dreamin', 'r w'at?
Is it yous, dad?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctor started, then, seizing his hat, he vanished
from the room, got into his buggy, and whipped away
as fast as his horse could travel.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE END OF THE MYSTERY.</p>


<p>Matt and Susie withdrew to the porch and softly
closed the door behind them. The minds of both of
them were in a daze. There were tears in Susie's eyes.</p>

<p>"Fellers useter act that way when I was rampin'
around in the hills," growled Welcome, with a fierce look
at the closed door; "but they was mostly lawless, an'
didn't keer fer no one. I got a mind to go right in
there an' drive the feller out!"</p>

<p>"Sh-h-h!" admonished Susie; "not so loud, Welcome.
It's Rags' father."</p>

<p>"Father!" echoed Welcome, Chub, and Clip.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Matt. "Don't it beat anything you ever
heard of, Clip? Bascomb is Rags' father! No wonder
he was in a hurry to get here. José, the Mexican that
was with Juan Morisco when the team ran away, found
Bascomb in the hills and told him of the accident. After
I fell in with Bascomb he started to asking me about
Rags. I'd no sooner told how badly hurt she was, when
he got in the biggest kind of a hurry to reach Ph&oelig;nix."</p>

<p>"We certainly got here on the jump," said Clip. "If
you want to get speed out of a motor, put Motor Matt
in charge."</p>

<p>"Didn't Rags tell you anything about herself?" asked
Matt.</p>

<p>"Not a word," said Chub.</p>

<p>"And she can't get well?"</p>

<p>Susie shook her head.</p>

<p>"Who's her father, anyhow?" spoke up Welcome.</p>

<p>"Joe Bascomb," answered Matt. "He's one of the
Dangerfield gang."</p>

<p>"You been mixin' up with that gang, Matt King?"
went on Welcome.</p>

<p>"You bet he has," said Clip. "Matt's done a lot of
mixing. Pretty hot, some of it."</p>

<p>"Where'd you go so sudden, pard?" came from Chub.
"What was it the governor wanted of you?"</p>

<p>"He wanted me to turn a 'century' in five hours," answered
Matt.</p>

<p>"Up Castle Creek Cañon and over the divide, at that,"
interpolated Clip. "He did it in less than five hours.
And fought smugglers all the way."</p>

<p>"But where'd he pick up this Bascomb?" persisted
Welcome. "That's what's worryin' me a hull lot."</p>

<p>"It's too long a yarn to spin now, Welcome," replied
Matt. "You'll get it all some time. What came over
the doctor all at once? Does anybody know?"</p>

<p>"Not me," said Chub. "He dug out o' here like he
had a hurry-up call over in town somewhere. Never
said a word, but just rolled into his buggy and began
kicking up the dust."</p>

<p>"He's coming back," reported Clip, his eyes up the
road. "Seems to be in as big a rush to get back as he
was to get away."</p>

<p>"That isn't the doctor," said Susie, as the rig drew
nearer. "There are two men in the buggy and neither
of them is the doctor."</p>

<p>"One's McKibben," said Chub, "and the other is
Sparks, his deputy. I'm next now. The doctor found
out Bascomb was one of the Dangerfield gang, and hot-footed
it for the sheriff's office."</p>

<p>The rig drew up with a rush in front of the gate, and
the two officers dropped out. Leaving Sparks to tie
the horse, McKibben hurried into the yard. Matt went
down the porch steps to meet him.</p>

<p>"Ah, King!" exclaimed the sheriff, a sparkle in his
eyes. "I thought you'd be back to-day. Made good,
as usual, eh? The doctor says one of the gang is here."</p>

<p>"He's in the house," said Matt. "He's the father of
the little girl, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The doctor told me that. Ever since Morisco told
me what he knew, I've been half-expecting this would
happen. The only thing in the way was having the
girl's father find out how badly she was hurt. Who
told him?"</p>

<p>"The Mexican that rode off on the horse when you
arrested Morisco."</p>

<p>"He couldn't have told him all&mdash;he didn't know it."</p>

<p>"Well, I told Bascomb what I knew."</p>

<p>"Bascomb?" queried the sheriff.</p>

<p>"That's the man's name."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"I'd leave him alone in there for a while, Mr. McKibben,"
went on Matt. "He's having a hard time of
it."</p>

<p>"I'll not bother him yet." McKibben turned to his
deputy who was just coming through the gate. "Go
around to the rear of the house, Sparks," said he, "and
see that he don't get out that way."</p>

<p>Sparks disappeared around the corner of the building.</p>

<p>"Did Morisco tell you anything about the girl, Mr.
McKibben?" queried Matt.</p>

<p>"He told me all about her," replied the sheriff. "Morisco
was sent on here to get the girl and take her out
to the Rio Verde. When the gang came along her father
was to pick her up and take her with him to Mexico.
This here Bascomb came from the East, and left the girl
behind him. From what I got from Morisco, I figure
that the little one had a hard time of it. Bascomb,
knowing the gang was soon going to change its location,
sent East and had the girl come to Ph&oelig;nix. José
is a brother of Juan's, and Bascomb had the wood-hauler
take charge of his daughter until he could get hold of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
her himself. When a man's a criminal, his operations
are a bit hampered. That's the way it was with Bascomb.
He had to watch his chance, send Juan in to
town, and have him bring the girl to the Rio Verde.
Only Juan didn't. Matters went a little wrong for him.
Trust a couple of greasers to botch things up! Why,
one of my men had spotted Juan Morisco the minute he
hit the Mexican quarter. We couldn't just identify him,
that was all. A piece of courtplaster covered the scar
on his face. The governor will be mighty tickled, Matt,
when he hears how you've made good."</p>

<p>"Have you heard how Burke came out?"</p>

<p>"Got a wire from Prescott an hour ago. Six of the
gang were captured at Tinaja Wells; the rest, including
Dangerfield, made a run of it and got clear. But I
reckon the smuggling of Chinks into this section has
been pretty well discouraged. You did a cracking good
piece of work for Uncle Sam yesterday, my boy."</p>

<p>"I wish it had turned out a little different," said Matt,
looking away.</p>

<p>"Different?" asked the sheriff. "How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"If poor little Rags could only have pulled
through&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We've got to take those things as we find 'em," said
McKibben gruffly. "It's hard lines, of course, and I'm
sorry for Bascomb. But he brought it all on himself.
If he'd have led an honest life, Rags wouldn't have
been left to shift for herself. Every man that goes
wrong pays the penalty&mdash;and sometimes makes others
pay part of it. How long has he been in there?" The
sheriff nodded toward the house.</p>

<p>"About half an hour," answered Matt.</p>

<p>"I reckon that's long enough."</p>

<p>McKibben walked to the steps and ascended to the
front door. Just as he was about to lay his hand on
the knob, the door opened and Bascomb shambled out.</p>

<p>He hardly looked like the same man. His shoulders
were drooping forward, his head was bowed, and his
face was heavy with grief. McKibben stepped up beside
him and laid a hand on his shoulder. Bascomb
started at the touch and lifted his head passively.</p>

<p>"Well?" said he, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"You're under arrest, Dangerfield," said McKibben.</p>

<p>Matt and Clip hardly believed their ears. Dangerfield!
Had McKibben made a mistake?</p>

<p>"Nothing much matters now, McKibben," returned the
prisoner wearily. He held out his hands, wrists together.
"I'm not armed, and I wouldn't make you any trouble
if I was."</p>

<p>A pair of handcuffs were snapped into place, and the
sheriff tucked a hand under his prisoner's arm and led
him down from the porch.</p>

<p>"All right, Sparks!" called the sheriff.</p>

<p>While the deputy was coming around the house, the
prisoner turned to Matt.</p>

<p>"Joe Bascomb Dangerfield, King, is my full name,"
said he. "I only gave you part of it. Some things you
didn't understand before I suppose are perfectly clear
to you now."</p>

<p>He faced the sheriff.</p>

<p>"Understand this, McKibben," he went on, "it was
Matt King who brought me in. He took charge of me
in Castle Creek Cañon. The reward goes to him."</p>

<p>"He'll be taken care of," said McKibben briefly.</p>

<p>Once more Dangerfield turned to Matt.</p>

<p>"You did your best for Ollie, King," he continued, a
shake in his voice. "Give me your hand."</p>

<p>The handcuffs rattled as Matt shook the prisoner's
hand; then, between McKibben and Sparks, Dangerfield
was led away.</p>

<p>Criminal though Dangerfield was, Matt pitied him
from the bottom of his heart. Instead of using the doctor's
rig for the return to town, the officers appropriated
the red roadster. Sparks got in behind, with the prisoner,
and McKibben took the driver's seat. They were
soon across the bridge and lost to sight.</p>

<p>"Waal, snakes alive!" muttered Welcome Perkins.
"Blamed if Matt didn't ketch the leader o' the gang
without never knowin' it."</p>

<p>Matt whirled and went into the house. Susie was
already in the front room. She motioned toward the
couch.</p>

<p>Rags was lying still and silent, her hands crossed on
her breast.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">MATT REPORTS TO THE GOVERNOR.</p>


<p>It was half-past five that afternoon when the <i>Comet</i>
came to a halt at the steps of the capitol building.
Motor Matt, in no very cheerful frame of mind, got off
the machine and made his way to the governor's office.</p>

<p>"Why, it's King!" smiled the secretary, meeting him
in the outer room.</p>

<p>"Is the governor here yet?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Yes, and expecting you. Mr. McKibben is with him.
The governor usually goes home at half-past four, but
he stayed later to-day, expressly to get your report. Just
a minute."</p>

<p>The secretary went to the door of the private office,
knocked, and vanished inside.</p>

<p>"Go right in," said he, when he had reappeared.</p>

<p>Cap in hand, Motor Matt passed into the other room.
Governor Gaynor met him at the door with a warm
handclasp.</p>

<p>"Motor Matt, King of the Motor Boys!" exclaimed the
governor, leading Matt to a chair. "Sit down, my lad,"
said he. "I'm not going to let you get away from here
for quite a while."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Matt pulled the envelope from his pocket.</p>

<p>"There, governor," said he, handing it over, "that
will tell you what time I made on that 'century' run."</p>

<p>Governor Gaynor read the penciled words on the
back of the envelope, and laughed. Then he passed the
writing on to McKibben. The sheriff chuckled.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with it?" asked Matt, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Didn't you read it?" asked McKibben.</p>

<p>"Haven't had much time to read it, Mr. McKibben,
since the sheriff gave it to me."</p>

<p>"Listen," and the sheriff read the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Governor</span>: This will certify that Motor Matt delivered
your message to me at five minutes of five, of the
same day he carried it out of Ph&oelig;nix. It will also certify
that he made the pluckiest and most successful hundred-mile
run ever pulled off in the Southwest. You
ought to make him your official courier, at ten thousand
a year.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Burke.</span>'"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Matt flushed.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know that the trip was anything to brag
about," said he. "Luck was with me&mdash;and the <i>Comet</i>
can go."</p>

<p>"Luck and pluck have a way of moving along together,"
said the governor, taking a roll of bills from
the desk and handing them to Matt. "There's your
hundred. But for your work, Matt, Burke would have
been helpless. I am pleased to say that there'll be a
thousand more coming to you just as soon as a few
formalities can be attended to. You won't leave for
Denver until after that?"</p>

<p>"Had I ought to take that reward-money, governor?
I don't feel right about it, somehow."</p>

<p>"Well, bless my soul!" exclaimed the governor. "It's
good money, and well-earned."</p>

<p>"What's more, Dangerfield himself wants you to have
it," put in McKibben. "It's the queerest situation I ever
went up against, governor," he added, turning to Gaynor.
"In spite of the fact that Matt captured Dangerfield
and brought him in, the boy seems to have made a
bigger hit with Dangerfield than with any one else."</p>

<p>"I didn't really capture him, Mr. McKibben," protested
Matt. "Dangerfield was coming to Ph&oelig;nix, anyway."</p>

<p>"Well, he's trying to help you to the tune of a thousand
dollars, and you'd better let him. Of course," went
on McKibben whimsically, "Sparks and I can use the
money if you can't."</p>

<p>"There&mdash;there'll be some expenses on Rags' account,"
said Matt, "and I want those to come out of the money."</p>

<p>The governor leaned back in his chair and studied
Matt thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"You're a queer one, Matt," said he, "and your sentiments
are an honor to you. Let it go that way, McKibben,"
he added to the sheriff.</p>

<p>"Sure!" said the sheriff heartily.</p>

<p>"And now," went on the governor, handing McKibben
a cigar and lighting one for himself, "tell us the whole
thing, Matt, from start to finish. Don't leave anything
out. I don't care if I never get supper."</p>

<p>Matt plunged into the recital. There were parts of it
he tried to glide over, but neither McKibben nor Gaynor
would let him. One or the other was always ready
with an adroit question which brought out the whole
story.</p>

<p>"Why," said the governor, when Matt had finished,
"that 'century' run alone was enough to make you famous,
but the finest part of your work was the way
you came in with Dangerfield."</p>

<p>"You can't beat it!" declared McKibben. "I need a
deputy sheriff, Matt. How'd you like the job?"</p>

<p>Matt shook his head. The sheriff was joking, and
Matt knew it. Anyhow, one job like that he had just
finished was enough for Matt.</p>

<p>"I'm going to need a secretary pretty soon," remarked
the governor; and he was in earnest, even if the sheriff
had not been. "How would you like <i>that</i> job?"</p>

<p>"I'd like it fine," answered Matt, "if there was a gasoline
motor mixed up in it."</p>

<p>"I wish there were," murmured the governor, "for I
can see where your work is cut out for you." He got
up and took his hat. "I'll see you again before you
start for Denver. It will probably be a few days before
that thousand will be turned over."</p>

<p>They left the office together, and the governor got into
his automobile at the curb.</p>

<p>"What will they do with Dangerfield, Mr. McKibben?"
inquired Matt, as he got ready to ride home on
the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>"He'll stand trial, along with the six men captured by
Burke," replied the sheriff. "All of them will get good,
long terms in a government prison. Also," added the
sheriff, "the two rascals who got out of town ahead of
you in that red roadster will have a chance to explain
matters. I'm holding the car, and they'll have to come
to me after it."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The red roadster was never claimed. Probably this
is not to be wondered at, considering the difficulties the
two men would have gotten themselves into had they
shown up at the sheriff's office.</p>

<p>Who the men were was never discovered. They had
been boarding in an obscure hotel, and had kept the
machine in a private garage. It was supposed that they
were criminals of some sort, and, if not actually allied
with the Dangerfield gang, had been commissioned by
the leader to keep watch of the sheriff.</p>

<p>Yet, be that as it might, both men vanished from
Frog Tanks and were never afterward located.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Two days later Ollie Dangerfield was laid away under
the palms and umbrella-trees in the Ph&oelig;nix cemetery.</p>

<p>Susie, Chub, Welcome, Matt, Clip, and many others
of the townspeople attended the funeral. The little
girl's story had become known through the town, and
had excited much interest and a good deal of sympathy
for Dangerfield.</p>

<p>During the days that followed, and while Matt was
waiting for the reward, a great plan had formed itself
in Clipperton's brain. He called on Matt at Mrs.
Spooner's, and placed it before him in all its dazzling
grandeur.</p>

<p>"That red roadster is a fine car, Matt," said Clip.
"You ought to know. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"It's a fast car," answered Matt guardedly. "Why,
Clip? What of it?"</p>

<p>"Suppose nobody claims it? What will be done with
it?"</p>

<p>"Give it up."</p>

<p>"Couldn't it be bought? Ought to be a bargain."</p>

<p>"Look here!" cried Matt, starting up in his chair.
"What are you trying to get through your head, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Why, it would be a heap easier for us. On that
Denver trip, I mean. If we could get hold of that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's a dream, old chap," laughed Matt. "Where's
the money to come from?"</p>

<p>"You'll have some. I can raise as much, I reckon."</p>

<p>A motor-car!</p>

<p>Matt's enthusiasm must have shown in his face. He
knew Clip's project was impracticable, for, even if they
could raise money enough between them to get the red
roadster, it would have been madness to put all their
funds into such a venture.</p>

<p>"We can do it, Matt!" cried Clip excitedly.</p>

<p>"No, Clip," returned Matt, coming down to earth
again, "we can't do it. We'd look nice with all our
money tied up in an automobile, wouldn't we? Get your
machine fixed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've had it fixed."</p>

<p>"Well, the motor-cycles ought to be good enough for
us."</p>

<p>"Don't you ever want an automobile? Wouldn't you
rather have it than a motor-cycle?"</p>

<p>"Sure; but we can't afford to own one. By the way,
just to change the subject a little, I've got something
here that'll interest you."</p>

<p>Matt took a folded paper out of his pocket.</p>

<p>"What is it?" inquired Clip, stepping to Matt's side.</p>

<p>"Just a minute, Clip," said Matt. "Did I tell you
that Dangerfield gave me a note, there in the notch, on
our way to Ph&oelig;nix, and told me to read it any time
after we reached town?"</p>

<p>Clip nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, I just read that note an hour ago. Most of
the things we couldn't understand about Dangerfield have
been cleared up, but here's a new mystery."</p>

<p>"You say it concerns me?" asked Clip, surprised.</p>

<p>"In a way, yes. Read it, and you'll see how."</p>

<p>Clip opened the note. It ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Motor Matt</span>: In a few days one of my men, named
Pima Pete, will try to get your help in a certain undertaking.
It's an honest undertaking, too, and I advise
you to do what you can. <i>You will find it profitable to
yourself.</i></p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Bascomb.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The name of Pima Pete brought a flush to Clipperton's
face.</p>

<p>"If Pete shows himself," said he, "he'll be arrested."</p>

<p>"I guess he knows that, all right," answered Matt.
"Whatever the work is, he may find a way of asking
my help without doing it in person."</p>

<p>"Will you help him?"</p>

<p>"That depends, Clip. We'll cross that bridge when
we get to it."</p>

<p>"As you say," said Clipperton, "it's a thing that interests
me. Promise me one thing: That you'll give me
a chance to help Pima Pete myself, in case you hear
from him."</p>

<p>"I had already made up my mind to that, Clip," replied
Motor Matt. "It may be a false alarm, though,
and nothing come of it."</p>

<p>Clip shook his head.</p>

<p>"I don't think Dangerfield is in the habit of giving
false alarms. Something is going to happen. And
soon."</p>

<p>Whether Clip would prove a true prophet or not, only
the future could tell, but Matt, having won out, did not
mean to borrow trouble, and so, boylike, let the morrow
take care of itself.</p>

<p>"I really think it was just the neatest thing that I ever
did in that line," said the grizzled old Captain Gapsill.</p>

<p>"To what do you allude?" I inquired, knowing that I was
about to hear something interesting.</p>

<p>"That little affair I had with Black Ben."</p>

<p>"Black Ben? Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Hain't you ever heard tell of him?" demanded the captain,
in amazement; and then, recollecting himself, he added:
"I forgot; that was before your time&mdash;at least, you must
have been quite a younker then. Black Ben, next to Mike
Fink, was one of the greatest pirates that ever infested the
Mississippi."</p>

<p>"What became of him?"</p>

<p>"I was going to tell you. In the first place, you mustn't
imagine he was a negro because he was called Black Ben.
He had a skin as dark as a mulatto's, and a fearful lot of
great, black, bushy hair, which stood up like bristles; and,
as he always went without a hat, I can tell you he was
just about the most villainous-looking creature you ever saw.
Besides that, he had jet-black whiskers, short and sticking
out like needles, and growing up almost to his eyes; so
when you looked at him you saw about a bushel of black,
bristling hair, and in the midst his great eyes glowing like
coals of fire. He wasn't more than five feet in height;
he had short legs, very long arms, and immense muscular
power. He generally went dressed as a backwoodsman,
and had two comrades&mdash;ordinary-looking men, but as bloody
and merciless cutthroats as he.</p>

<p>"Black Ben had been seen as far up as Cairo, and as
low down as Natchez. He was such a queer-looking creature
that it was impossible for him to disguise himself
enough to go among the towns or where he would have
run any danger. His principal hunting-ground was from
the mouth of the Arkansas north to the Tennessee line.
Here he had all the opportunity he wished for hiding himself,
and I don't believe a party of red Indians ever could
have hunted him to his hole. If he hadn't met his fate
in the queer manner he did he might have hunted there until
he died of old age.</p>

<p>"In those days a great many flatboats used to pass down
the Mississippi on their way to New Orleans, and these
were the favorite prey of Black Ben and his men. As the
river navigation, with its snags and sawyers, is always so
dangerous, these boats often lay to under the bank during
the night, when the chances are ten to one that the sharp
eyes of these pirates detected them, and, at the dead hour
of midnight, they stole out as silently as shadows, crept
over the boat, cut the throats of the unsuspicious sleepers,
gutted the craft, then scuttled it and set it afloat. Out in
deep water it would sink, and that would be the last ever
seen or heard of that flatboat.</p>

<p>"Black Ben was a horrid dog, and it was no wonder that
there was such terror of him all along the river. Captain
Hallongton, an old friend of mine, had his boat served in
this manner, but the night was so dark that he managed
to swim off, although his three men were every one of
them murdered. The captain had a hard story to tell, and
he offered five hundred dollars to any one who would shoot
this bloody cutthroat.</p>

<p>"I had been from Cincinnati down to New Orleans fully
a dozen times without once encountering this redoubtable
Blue Beard. I had lain to at a place where, it was said, he
would be sure to find us; but never once did we catch sight
or sound of him, and I would have doubted his existence
but for the testimony of Captain Hallongton and his friends,
whom I could not refuse to believe.</p>

<p>"'It is strange that I never meet him.' I once said, when
he and I were conversing together regarding this river outlaw.
'It must be that he is either afraid of me, or else has
a feeling of friendship toward me.'</p>

<p>"'Don't congratulate yourself too soon,' replied my friend.
'Depend upon it, Black Ben will yet pay you a visit.'</p>

<p>"'I have heard so much of him that I must say my
curiosity is really greater than my terror.'</p>

<p>"'See here!' interrupted the captain, starting up in sudden
excitement; 'you're going to start down the river next
week?'</p>

<p>"'A week from to-morrow.'</p>

<p>"'Good! You take Dick and Tom, your usual help?'</p>

<p>"'Of course.'</p>

<p>"'I ship with you as a common hand, just on purpose
to help you to a sight of Black Ben. What do you say?'</p>

<p>"The proposition struck me very favorably, and I urged
the captain to it. As he was ten times as rich as I was, I
didn't exactly like the idea of his going as a common hand,
although on my flatboat there was no other position for
him. It was finally agreed that he should pass himself as
one of my assistants; but as there was no need of his work,
he was to do little more than dress himself as such, to
deceive any one whom we might encounter, while he might
accommodate the labor to himself.</p>

<p>"We made all our arrangements as if certain of encountering
this fellow. We went more fully armed than we ever
did before, and it was agreed that when we reached that
part of the river where we had reason to expect the appearance
of Black Ben, or where there was the least likelihood
of his seeing us, that nobody should show themselves
above deck except Captain Hallongton and myself. This
was for the purpose of making the pirate believe there were
only two of us on board, and thus luring him on to what
we hoped would be his destruction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, we swung loose from Cincinnati one fine morning,
and in due time reached the Mississippi, and lay to at
Memphis, Tennessee, one stormy night, where we fixed
everything to our satisfaction. When we started next morning,
Tom and Dick were sent down below in the cabin, with
the understanding that they were not to show themselves
until they had permission to do so.</p>

<p>"It was late in the autumn of 1838, and I remember that
the weather was quite chilly, so much so that both Hallongton
and myself kept on our overcoats all the time. We
passed to and fro, plainly showing ourselves to any one
who might be along the bank. Tom and Dick were allowed
to come up only when the night was dark, and then they
exchanged places with us, so that under no circumstances
were more than two of us visible at the same time.</p>

<p>"Down below Helena, on the Arkansas side, we had
fixed as the place where we might reasonably look for the
appearance. There was a long stretch of wood country,
where the wretch's most inhuman deeds had been located.</p>

<p>"It was a cold, blustering night that we worked our boat
under the wooded shore and made fast to the identical spot,
where my friend had had his memorable adventure with
Black Ben. He recognized it by several landmarks, and
assured me that we would hear from the gentleman before
many hours had passed over our heads.</p>

<p>"For the last few miles, before tying up, we had kept
up a sharp scrutiny of the shores, in the hope of detecting
some signs of the outlaw. I saw nothing; but Hallongton
was positive he caught several glimpses of a man flitting
along the Arkansas bank, and maintaining a sharp watch
upon our movements.</p>

<p>"After we had securely tied up our boat, we went below,
after our supper, and then made our final arrangements.
I should state here that my flatboat was one made after
a fashion of my own. It was long and quite narrow, the
cabin being, as usual, in the rear. This was made of double
thick planking, immediately adjoining the cargo, which
stretched away to the bow. A small orifice had been bored
through this planking, so that one in the cabin could talk in
a whisper to one who was in the main body of the boat
among our cargo of pork. This was done at the suggestion
of Captain Hallongton, in accordance with a plan which we
had formed between us.</p>

<p>"When it was fully dark, Tom and Dick crept carefully
over the cabin, in among the pork, and took their position
near the hole which I have just mentioned. When we had
chatted together a while, Hallongton did the same, while I
maintained my place near the cabin.</p>

<p>"We were so close under the bank that a long limb hung
directly over the cabin.</p>

<p>"As it looked quite thick and strong, I grasped it with
my hands and swung myself upon it. The next moment
I had climbed to the top of the tree, and seated myself
near the trunk astride of a large limb, where I patiently
awaited whatever was to come.</p>

<p>"Our plans were fully agreed upon, and I knew that I
might have sat there until morning without hearing a word
from them, or detecting an impatient movement upon their
part.</p>

<p>"The night, for a time, was pitchy dark, but the moon
soon came up over the river, shedding a light which made
the opposite shore visible, and gave me a little uneasiness
as to whether I would not be detected from the ground
below. However, as our line of action had been agreed
upon, it was now too late for us to make any change in
our part of the program.</p>

<p>"I was speculating on these matters, when a slight noise
below attracted my attention, and, looking down, I could
discern a dark body, moving cautiously toward the boat. In
the shadow of the wood, the gloom was too great to make
out its identity; but, while I was looking, it leaped as lightly
and dexterously as a monkey upon the gunwale, and the
next minute I saw that Black Ben was on the flatboat.</p>

<p>"In the bright moonlight he was plainly visible, and answered
perfectly the description which I have given. He
circled around the boat with the silence of a phantom, and
finally halted near the cabin and listened as if to hear the
breathing of those within. Having finished his reconnoisance,
he sprang lightly ashore and disappeared.</p>

<p>"I had seen no one but Black Ben, but a slight noise
heard when he was on the boat satisfied me that he had
one companion at least with him, and I was sure that he
would speedily return.</p>

<p>"I was now anxious to hear whether Captain Hallongton
had seen the pirate and whether he was 'posted.'</p>

<p>"To satisfy myself, I gave a low whistle. It was immediately
replied to&mdash;a fact which convinced me that my friends
were 'all right.'</p>

<p>"It was plain that Black Ben had no suspicion of the
little plan which we had concocted for his benefit; but
whether that same little plan of ours would miscarry or not
was another question, for we knew that the outlaw was a
desperate character, who would play the mischief if he
should ever get into close quarters.</p>

<p>"Now came a period of watching and waiting, continued
so long that I had great fear that Black Ben had scented
danger and concluded to give us a wide berth. Fully two
hours passed away, with me shivering and cramped in the
tree; but I had resolved to stay there until morning if the
outlaw did not make his appearance before that time.</p>

<p>"It could not have been far from midnight when I caught
the rustling of bushes beneath me, and I felt sure that Black
Ben was there; but, as I peered down, I was disappointed
in discerning not a man, but a large black bear that was
lumbering along the shore and awkwardly approaching the
flatboat. Reaching it, he waded into the water, snuffed
around the boat, poked his nose against it, struck his paws
against it, and made a racket which struck me as singular
upon the part of a bear.</p>

<p>"'I would soon stop your sport,' I reflected, 'if I were not
watching for bigger game.'</p>

<p>"I was watching the brute, when something in his manner
of moving about attracted my suspicion, and I scanned him
more narrowly than I had yet done. My heart gave a great
leap as I penetrated the ruse, and discovered that instead
of the object under me being a bear, it was only a man
disguised as such. His object in making such a tumult
around the boat was evidently to learn whether the men
on board were asleep.</p>

<p>"Occasionally the creature paused and was perfectly still,
as if listening; but nothing but the sullen surging of the
muddy Mississippi, or the dipping of some overhanging
branch was heard, and, becoming satisfied that everything
was in the shape desired, the bear withdrew from the water,
and tumbled away into the wood, in a style which he hardly
would have dared to use had he been aware that a pair
of eyes were intently scrutinizing his every movement.</p>

<p>"A half-hour later, a form sprang from the dark line of
wood which lined the shore, landing on the gunwale of the
boat at a single bound. One glance was sufficient for me to
see that Black Ben had boarded the <i>General Jackson</i>, and
that the critical moment was at hand.</p>

<p>"The hideous-looking creature glided as swiftly and silently
as a shadow from one part of the boat to the other,
in order to assure himself that no one was watching in
any of the out-of-the-way places. He then glided back
to the cabin and made a single motion with his arm. The
response was in the shape of another dark form, which
leaped beside him with all the agility of a monkey.</p>

<p>"From where I sat I had both of these precious scamps
in range, and I could have sent a bullet crashing through
both of them; but, as that was not the plan agreed upon, I
concluded to wait.</p>

<p>"As I had always understood that Black Ben was accompanied
by two men, I looked for the appearance of his companion;
but, as the bushy-headed chief turned his head upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
the shore the instant he was joined by his friend, I supposed
that he was absent, and would not appear in this matter,
which pleased me greatly, as it could not but make the matter
all the more easy for us.</p>

<p>"The two villains put their heads together and seemed
to converse a while in the same manner that you frequently
see horses or cows do. Agreeing upon their course of
action, Black Ben quietly drew back the slide which covered
the door which communicated with the cabin. Flashing a
sort of bull's-eye lantern down into the gloom, he leaned
his head forward and scanned every part of the cabin.</p>

<p>"And I know what he saw. What were apparently two
human forms wrapped up in their blankets and sound asleep.
The next instant the sharp report of two pistols in immediate
succession broke the stillness, and Black Ben and his
comrade sprang down into the cabin.</p>

<p>"Just what we wanted. Hardly a second had elapsed
when I was on deck, and had slid the door back to its place
at the same moment that Captain Hallongton and Tom
and Dick hurriedly clambered up beside me.</p>

<p>"'We've got 'em!' exclaimed the captain delightedly. 'Be
quick and fasten that down.'</p>

<p>"Everything had been prepared for such a dénouement
as this, and not ten seconds passed ere we had Black Ben
and his friend firmly imprisoned.</p>

<p>"The next proceeding of Captain Hallongton was to
dance a double shuffle upon the deck and exclaim: 'We've
got him! we've got him!'</p>

<p>"'Keep still,' I said; 'you act like a crazy man.'</p>

<p>"'Do you know there is a thousand dollars offered for
his head in New Orleans?' said he.</p>

<p>"I didn't know that, and I felt somewhat like making as
big a fool of myself over it, but I did not.</p>

<p>"The next thing we heard was a terrible rumpus below&mdash;swearing
and yelling enough to raise the hair on your head.
But what cared we? We had the mighty river-pirate,
Black Ben, and one of his comrades in our power.</p>

<p>"Not knowing but what some of his friends might be in
the neighborhood, we untied the fastenings of the boat and
swung out into the stream. We ran considerable risk in
so doing, as this was a dangerous part of the river, but
Captain Hallongton understood the current better than I
did, and we decided that this was the safest and best thing
that we could do under the circumstances.</p>

<p>"The tempest and tumult continued below until we were
in the middle of the Mississippi and gliding rapidly down
the stream. Then a silence came, and Black Ben called up
to us and asked us what this all meant. We told him that
we had caught him trespassing on our boat and intended
to take him down to New Orleans and sell him. The answer
to this was a couple of pistol-shots fired at the spot where
he supposed I was standing. It struck beneath my feet, and
no doubt he imagined it would pass through the planking
and kill me; but it was bullet-proof and there was no danger.
Finding he could do no harm he took a different course
of action. He tried to bribe us to let him go, and made us
repeated offers until he reached a figure as high as ten
thousand dollars. We told him we would take time to think
about it, but we were not quite fools enough to accept any
offer which he could make. We knew that all he wanted
was to get out on deck, and then there would be the tallest
kind of a rumpus. Our only safety was in keeping him
just where he was and not give him the slightest advantage.</p>

<p>"Finding his efforts in this direction useless, he fell upon
his first plan, of swearing. I have heard some terrible profanity
in my time, but I don't think I ever heard anything
to equal that of Black Ben. He kept it up until morning,
and then all was still again.</p>

<p>"I suppose you understand the way in which we trapped
our bird? Captain Hallongton had taken the trouble of
finding out Black Ben's manner of doing business and had
laid his plans accordingly. It was his custom to wait until
the crew of the boats he intended to rob went asleep, and
he then stole aboard and quietly despatched them either
with the knife or pistol. Knowing this, we had arranged a
couple of dummies, which, as we intended, were mistaken
by the river-pirate for the entire crew of the <i>General Jackson</i>.
The small orifice which I first spoke of as connecting
the cabin with the main body of the boat had been made by
Captain Hallongton, so that in case there was parley between
him and Black Ben before surrendering the boat, the
latter personage could thus be made to believe that it came
from one of the forms inside, but his course of action rendered
this precaution unnecessary.</p>

<p>"We ran a great deal more danger in capturing this renowned
outlaw than any of us imagined. We had carefully
removed everything in the shape of a knife or hatchet or
any kind of a weapon from the cabin, and yet we had every
reason to believe that both of these dogs would have
their knives with them; but by a purely providential circumstance
neither of them carried anything with them except
their pistols. How it came about, I cannot say, for it
certainly was odd. Had either of them their weapons, it
would have taken them but a few hours to cut their way
through the planking, thick as it was, and we would have
been compelled to shoot them to save ourselves from being
shot.</p>

<p>"If they had become satisfied that there was no hope for
them, the next thing in order would have been the bottom
of the boat. They would have made a leak which would
have carried themselves and the flatboat to the bottom, and
likely enough ourselves, too, for you must know it is no
easy matter to make your way through the Mississippi at
high water.</p>

<p>"We did not feel easy when we heard them thumping
and rubbing the side of the boat, for we were well aware
what wonderful things these desperate characters do when
they find themselves in such desperate straits.</p>

<p>"Captain Hallongton stood with his loaded rifle, expecting
almost every moment to see Black Ben burst out to
view like a raging fury. By placing our ears against the
cabin we could hear a peculiar grinding noise, which told
us that the gentlemen in there were doing something, although
what it was we could only guess. We could hear
them muttering and talking to each other, but I could not
catch any of the words uttered.</p>

<p>"Toward the close of the second day, just as we came
within sight of the Crescent City, two pistol-shots broke the
stillness. We could only conjecture what it meant. My
supposition was that they had shot themselves, but Captain
Hallongton suspected it was only a stratagem to get us to
open the cabin door to give them a final chance to escape,
or an opportunity to put a bullet through some of us who
might look down. So we paid no heed, but kept on floating
down the river.</p>

<p>"When we had tied up at the wharf, we brought a number
of police officers, acquainted them with our prize, surrounded
the boat, and then removed the door of the cabin.
We waited a long time, but no one came forth, nor did
any sound betray the presence of the men within. At last,
one of the officers, more venturesome than the rest, ventured
to steal up to the cabin and look down. The next
instant he uttered a shout and sprang down, while we rushed
toward the cabin.</p>

<p>"One glance showed all. Black Ben and his comrade
had both shot themselves, and were stone dead. They had
no knives, as I said, but with their simple pistol-barrels
they had almost cut their way through the planking. I
do believe that if New Orleans had been a hundred miles
farther off these two precious scamps would have got out
of the cabin and, perhaps, effected their escape.</p>

<p>"However, we had the satisfaction of receiving one thousand
dollars reward, and of knowing that we had cleared
the Mississippi of one of the most desperate outlaws that
ever infested its banks."</p>
